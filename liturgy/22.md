# Vatican II

## 2024-11-18

### Outline
- Walkthrough of *Sacrosanctum Concilium*

> [!tip] Pastoral note (xxx)
> Liturgical preaching -- use the particular saint and the liturgy itself to help with preaching
> Walking through the dimensions of the mass, or having an emphasis on the mass, makes an important point of the universality of the liturgy.

Everything you see or hear at the liturgy should lift the mind towards God

### I. General Principles for the Restoration and Promotion of the Sacred Liturgy
#### Didactic and Pastoral Norms
Preservation of Latin and use of the vernacular (36)
- Latin is to be preserved but wider use of vernacular frequently of advantage, especially in the readings, directives, prayers, and chants
- Whether and to what extent the vernacular is used is determined by territorial ecclesiastical authority 
- Translations from Latin must be approved

#### Inculturation Norms
No rigid uniformity necessary in matters which do not involve faith or the good of the whole Church (37)

Legitimate variation possible of substantial unity of the Roman rite is preserved (38)

Local authorities can determine adaptations (39)

For more radical adaptation and experiments, the Holy See must approve (40)

#### Promotion of Liturgical Life in the Diocese and Parish
The Bishop should be held in high esteem in the liturgical life of the diocese; pre-eminent manifestation of the Church in the cathedral liturgy (41)

Priests take the place of the bishop in a parish liturgy -- sense of community is to be encouraged in parishes, especially in Sunday Mass (42)
- The priest extends the apostolic ministry of the parish into his church
- Reference to the titular churches

#### Promotion of Pastoral Liturgical Action
Zeal for the promotion/restoration of the liturgy is a movement of the Holy Spirit (43).
- Establishment of liturgical commissions and institutes (44); each diocese should have a commission on:
    1. Liturgy
    2. Art
    3. Music

> [!dict] Commission vs Institute
> Commissions are directly connected to the bishop and have a special authority pertaining the to the liturgy; institutes have a more didactic dimension, and are oriented towards teaching

### II. The Most Sacred Mystery of the Eucharist
The Eucharist was instituted by our Savior to perpetuate the sacrifice of the
Cross and entrusted to the Church (47)
- Highlights the historical reality of the Last Supper
- Highlights that what Christ did can never be forgotten

The Church desires that the faithful should not be "strangers or silent spectators" but conscious and taking part with devotion and "full collaboration;" they should be instructed by God's word, nourished at the Lord's table, give thanks, and offer the victim from through priest and themselves as well (48).

Pastoral decrees on Masses with the faithful, especially on Sundays and Holy Days (49)
- Clarify intrinsic nature of the parts of the Mass and the connection among them -- simplify and restore with the vigor of the Fathers (50)

Lavishly open the treasures of the scriptures (51)

Homily is a part of the liturgy; required on Sundays and Holy Days of obligation
(52).

Restore prayers of the Faithful (53)

Vernacular -- readings and common prayers or more extended use of the mother tongue (54)
> [!quote] SC 54
> ... care must be taken to ensure that the faithful may also be able to say or sing together in Latin those parts of the Ordinary of the Mass which pertain to them. 

Encouragement for people to receive from the Hosts consecrated at the same Mass -- communion under both kinds may be granted (55). 
- cf. *Mediator Dei* -- participating at the same sacrifice

The Liturgy of the Word and the Eucharistic Liturgy form a single act of worship (56).

Concelebration, which manifests the unity of the priesthood and remained in used in the East and West, is extended (57).
- Each priest retains the right to celebrate Mass individually (preference vs. doctrine)

> [!example] Concelebration in the Middle Ages
> - Ordination of a bishop
> - Ordination of a new priest
> - Lyon -- on Holy Thursday, six concelebrants

> [!aside] Daily Mass
> Celebrating Mass everyday is not required by law, but the strength of pastoral encouragement is high due to the great graces imparted with the Mass.


### V. The Liturgical Year

#### Nature of the Liturgical Year
Primacy of Sunday, the Lord's day, and its connection to Easter (102)

> [!aside]
> Easter was the first instituted feasted in the Church. It is the heart of the liturgical year, each Sunday being a 'little Easter' or 'little Resurrection'

Yearly unfolding of the whole mystery of Christ (102)

> Ordinary Time II -- highlights Christ's presence in His Church

The Blessed Virgin Mary occupies a special place (103)

Memorial days for martyrs and other saints (104)

Liturgical seasons, penitential observances (105)
- Recall -- the sanctification of time

#### Decrees
Sunday obligation; original and greatest feast day; kernal of the whole year
(106)

Liturgical year to be revised (107)

Minds of the faithful should be directed towards fears of the Lord and the mysteries of salvation, which should take precedence over the feasts of the saints (108)

Baptism and Penance should be given greater emphasis during Lent (109)

In Lent, Penance should be social; Paschal fast is retained and extended where possible (110)

Feasts of the saints should not overtake those celebrating the mysteries of salvation.
`
> [!dict] Memorial vs. Optional Memorial
> There are some feats of saints which have a universal importance for the Church. St. Augustine had a remarkable and universal influence, so it is a universal memorial.
> St. Hedwig had a great regional influence, so that celebration is less universal and thus an optional memorial.

### VI. Sacred Music
#### Musical Heritage of the Church
"Inestimable value, greater even than that of any other art" (112)

Should be closely connected with the liturgical rites

#### Decrees
Preference for liturgical music (sung) with ministers and active participation of the people (113)

Treasury of music is to be preserved and cultivated - -so that the whole body of the faithful can contribute (114)

Importance of teaching and practicing of music and seminaries (115)

Pride of place to Gregorian Chant, but other kinds of sacred music not excluded (116)

Singing by the faithful is encouraged (118)

Local musical traditions, especially in missions, can have a place (119)

Pipe organ is held in high esteem, but other instruments may be used if "accord with the dignity of the temple" (120)

Texts should be sung to conform with Catholic doctrine (121)

### VII. Sacred Art and Sacred Furnishings
#### Purpose of Art
Among the noblest of man's genius, directed toward expressing the infinite
beauty of God (122)

> [!quote]
> All things set apart for use in divine worship should be worthy,  becoming, and beautiful

> [!quote]
> sacred furnishings should worthily and beautifully serve the dignity of worship

#### Decrees
The Church has not adopted any particular style  of art, "provided it bring to
the task  the reverence and honor due to the sacred buildings and rites" (123)

Seek "noble beauty rather than sumptuous display" -- and also that works of
art "repugnant to faith, morals, and Christian piety, and which offend true
religious sense either by depraved forms or by lack of artistic worth..." be
removed (124) 

Sacred images commended, but their "number should be moderate and their relative positions reflect right order" (125)

> [!quote] 126
> Ordinaries should ensure that sacred furnishings and works of value are not disposed of or destroyed

Encouragement of the arts (127)

Laws should reflect the reformed liturgy (128) ?

Clerics should be taught about sacred art (129)

Pontifical reserved to those of Episcopal rank (130)
