#### Greco-roman definition of liturgy
" A public office which a citizen undertakes to administer at his own expense,
and which involves civic and religious duties"

Takeaways:
- "public" - action of Church, not private or personal
- "citizen" - individuates participate as members of a body/corporate
- "at own expense" - element of sacrifice
- "duty/action" - not texts, rubrics, but an act of worship; just as a page of
music is not a symphony, Liturgy is not simply a set of directions
    - it was something *done*
