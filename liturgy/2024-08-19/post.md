I appreciate how the institution narratives in the synoptic gospels build on
each other in detail, which I would not have noticed if I did not read them all
at the same time. For example, Matthew is the most vague in describing where and
how his disciples should find the place for the passover. Mark then tells us
that the will find a man carrying water, who will show them the place. Luke then
tells us that the disciples were Peter and John.
