####  Why study the liturgy?
"The very work of His incarnation and passion continues in the Mass"

The Church directs us to
- SC 16
- *inter Oecumenici* 11-17
- The church guides us in this to go pray the liturgy more deeply

Doctrinal and Dogmatic value:
- *loci theologici* - One of the unique places of tradition and a repository of
the deposit of faith
    - There are a variety of places the OHAC comes from
        - Scriptures
        - fathers
        - saints
        - papal magisterial
        - liturgy itself
            - Through looking at the liturgy, we see what God has revealed
- *tradition* -  the liturgy is a prime example of the essential transmission of
something not contained formally in scripture, e.g. Communion of saints, their
intercession, prayers of the Dead, veneration of images.
    - Apostolic tradition is the ultimate and single source from which we derive
    the single faith
        - 
- *Lex orandi, lex credendi* 
    - As the Church prays, so she believes
    - "prayer itself expresses the Apostolic faith itself"
    - liturgy expresses the faith shapes the faith, and is a form of catechesis
        - Pius XI 1936 "the liturgy is the most important organ of the Church in
        the ordinary exercise of its teaching office"
    - The Trinitarian doxology expresses faith in the Holy Trinity as One God,
    and three Persons

- authoritative understanding of sacred scripture; the liturgy is an
interpretation that brings home the meaning of the sacred texts
    - the selection of the readings in the lectionary
    - The passages used in the liturgy itself ("holy, holy, holy...")
    - the liturgical cycle

- to fully invest yourself into the priestly promises
    - "Do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently, in accord with the
    Church's tradition, the mysteries of Christ, especially the sacrifice of the
    Eucharist and the sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God ad the
    sanctification of the Christian people?"

- spiritual and pastoral growth
    - conscious, active, and fruitful participation
        - first our own, then of others
    - When you are aware of the history or theological meanings of certain
    aspects of the Mass, it enables you to draw deeper into them
        - *Didache*: for the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and
        forever
        - Seeing the Host at the elevation: the awareness of the faith that
        permeated the middle ages and the faithful's desire to be blessed simply
        by seeing Jesus in the most Blessed Sacrament
    - The study of history and theology of the liturgy gains its full fruit by
    participation in the liturgy itself,


#### Formation for and by the liturgy

Two forms of liturgical formation (*Desiderio Desideravi*)
- Drawn from Romano Guardini
- Formation **for** the liturgy (study)
- Formation **by** the liturgy (participation)
- The first depends on the second (DD 34)
"The ministers who preside in the assembly must know the way, know it from
having studied it on the map of their theological studies but also from having
frequented the liturgy in actual practice of an experience of living faith,
nourished by prayer" (36)
- Our greatest formation in the liturgy will come from engaging it with our
whole being

We study the liturgy so we can enter more deeply into it

### The term "Liturgy"
- Greek/Latin terms
- what is liturgy?
- dimensions of liturgy
- basic structure of the liturgy

#### Etymology of the term "liturgy"
leitourgia - from laos, "people" and "ergon" "work"

Liturgy means "public work" and "service in the name of and on behalf of the
people" (CCC 1069)
- the liturgy is the Church's official *public work of worship*
through it, Christ continues the work of Redemption
    - Jesus' work of his Sacrifice on behalf of God the Father which saves the Christian people
- the liturgy is the participation of the *People of God* in "the work of God"


#### Greco-roman definition of liturgy
" A public office which a citizen undertakes to administer at his own expense,
and which involves civic and religious duties"

Takeaways:
- "public" - action of Church, not private or personal
- "citizen" - individuates participate as members of a body/corporate
- "at own expense" - element of sacrifice
- "duty/action" - not texts, rubrics, but an act of worship; just as a page of
music is not a symphony, Liturgy is not simply a set of directions
    - it was something *done*

#### The term
Liturgy is an ancient word used in OT and NT
- This means its biblical
- Luke 1:23 - Zechariah's service in the temple
- Hebrews 8:6 - Christ's liturgy is superior
- Exodus 28:35 - services of the priest in the temple
- Romans 15:16 - Paul is a servant (liturgist) of Christ
- Romans 15:26f - Collection for the poor
- Acts 13:2 - worship

Used in ancient Greek ecclesial writings
- service to God
- service to community
- by the 300's in the East, almost exclusively used for the Holy Eucharist

In the West, the word gave way to other terms and was not used again officially
in documents until the 1800's

Latin terms for liturgy
- *munus* - service, duty, tax, gift, entertainment
- *officium* - service, ceremonial duty, official duty (divine office)
- *servitus* - service, slavery
- *ministerium* - service, official duty
- *sacramentum* - oath of allegiance
- *mysterium* - secret; mystery, secret religion

The Greco-Roman, scriptural, and ancient eastern and western ecclesial
connotations are in harmony, not competition
