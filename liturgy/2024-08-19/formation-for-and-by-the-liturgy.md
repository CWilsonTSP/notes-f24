####  Why study the liturgy?
"The very work of His incarnation and passion continues in the Mass"

The Church directs us to
- SC 16
- *inter Oecumenici* 11-17
- The church guides us in this to go pray the liturgy more deeply

Doctrinal and Dogmatic value:
- *loci theologici* - One of the unique places of tradition and a repository of
the deposit of faith
    - There are a variety of places the OHAC comes from
        - Scriptures
        - fathers
        - saints
        - papal magisterial
        - liturgy itself
            - Through looking at the liturgy, we see what God has revealed
- *tradition* -  the liturgy is a prime example of the essential transmission of
something not contained formally in scripture, e.g. Communion of saints, their
intercession, prayers of the Dead, veneration of images.
    - Apostolic tradition is the ultimate and single source from which we derive
    the single faith
        - 
- *Lex orandi, lex credendi* 
    - As the Church prays, so she believes
    - "prayer itself expresses the Apostolic faith itself"
    - liturgy expresses the faith shapes the faith, and is a form of catechesis
        - Pius XI 1936 "the liturgy is the most important organ of the Church in
        the ordinary exercise of its teaching office"
    - The Trinitarian doxology expresses faith in the Holy Trinity as One God,
    and three Persons

- authoritative understanding of sacred scripture; the liturgy is an
interpretation that brings home the meaning of the sacred texts
    - the selection of the readings in the lectionary
    - The passages used in the liturgy itself ("holy, holy, holy...")
    - the liturgical cycle

- to fully invest yourself into the priestly promises
    - "Do you resolve to celebrate faithfully and reverently, in accord with the
    Church's tradition, the mysteries of Christ, especially the sacrifice of the
    Eucharist and the sacrament of Reconciliation, for the glory of God ad the
    sanctification of the Christian people?"

- spiritual and pastoral growth
    - conscious, active, and fruitful participation
        - first our own, then of others
    - When you are aware of the history or theological meanings of certain
    aspects of the Mass, it enables you to draw deeper into them
        - *Didache*: for the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and
        forever
        - Seeing the Host at the elevation: the awareness of the faith that
        permeated the middle ages and the faithful's desire to be blessed simply
        by seeing Jesus in the most Blessed Sacrament
    - The study of history and theology of the liturgy gains its full fruit by
    participation in the liturgy itself,
