# 17 -- Gothic Period and the Real Presence and Adoration
## 2024-10-24

### Historical Context
Eastern-Western Schism
- 1054, mutual excommunications of the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople
- In spite of some periodic attempts at reconciliation, this effectively ended
communication and interchange between east and west and so each developed
liturgy independently of and sometimes in opposition to each other

Feudalism and Resurgence of the Papacy
- Due to Feudalism, the Church and State were deeply intertwined and the lines of
authority were often unclear: a bishop or abbot could be the vassal of a lay
lord or also a temporal ruler with vassals
- Was a source of the unity of Christendom and of power struggles
- With new strong popes in the 11th century, the Papal chapel becomes the new
model and source of standardization for the Mass

Gothic Cultural revival (12th into 16th century)
- Growth in economics, art, architecture, music, and education would remarkably
influence the setting of the ordered liturgy

New Mendicant Orders
- Would develop new Missals, popularize the private Mass, and as a result
increase private lay devotion to allegory, the passion, and the rosary

Renewed heresies and new shifts in theological understanding of the Mass
- Inspired new liturgical practices and brought marked changes in sacramental
emphases

#### Gregory VII (d. 1085) and Resurgence of the Papacy
As Charlemagne desired political unity, Gregory wanted ecclesial unity
- Suppressed Spanish liturgy (Mozarabic) except in Toledo; also the Celtic rites
- standardized the Divine Office
- Asserted exclusive papal right of canonization

Gregory wanted to strengthen papal authority
- Earlier liturgical authority had been in the hands of Emporor and local
bishops; now took liturgical leadership into his own hands
- he ordered local bishops to use the Roman rite (Roman in origin, but by this
time had adapted and modified by the Gallican-Franco-Germanic influences)

State subordinate to the Church
- Political arm had dominated the Church under Otto and his successors, and
kings often appointed bishops
- Now bishops were again anointing kings; Gregory had established that the
spiritual order of the Church was higher than the secular order
- **Christendom** -- a society governed by the life of the Church, in which
political rules carried out the practice duties of governance but under the
guidance of society's spiritual leaders

#### The Papal Chapel
Change in the normative liturgy in Rome from the Stational Mass to the private
papal Mass in the Lateran chapel
- Beginning in the 11th century, and especially in the 12th, popes began to
withdraw from direct pastoral work -- the papal court (the Curia) began to
identify itself more and more with the universal Church, leaving the pastoral
administration of the local Roman church to assisting bishops
- Pope seen more as head of Curia than as a pastor of a local flock; therefore
he would not appear in public, but would celebrate Mass for the Curia

New papl liturgical books developed in this setting
- Innocent III (1198-1216) had a book compiled for the Divine Office in precise
rubrics
- Honorius III (1217-1227) produced a book designed for daily celebration in the
papal chapel
    - It became a model for liturgy which was not the full, solemn celebration,
    but a simple one for a small group (low mass)
    - Roman-Frankish-German liturgy was abbreviated and reorganized

#### Gothic Period
12th and 13th century were something of a golden age of cultural revitalization:
great synthesis of faith and life, unity of society, of Church and Sate, and
great cultural advances
- Economic development reached a new high
    - Cities came to new life, trade imporived with better roads and
    transportation; agriculture stimulated, credit and market blossomed
    - a "middle class" developed, who desired to be educated
- Education
    - Universities hgtew from monastic and cathedral schools
    - Theology and scholastiscim flourished
- Art and architecture
    - New Gothic style -- original, daring, creative, like Aquinas' theological
    synthesis; nothing equaled this style before or since
    - The Gothic is to architecture what the Summa is to Theology; it reflected
    great cultural and spiritual progress

#### Gothic architecture
Gothic architecture was the first and only really new architecture after the
Greco-Roman style
- Since Romanesque, Byzantine, and Baroque were really Roman-Pagan architecture
recycled, Gothic is perhaps the most truly distinctive Christian architecture
- Romanesque was a primitive adaptation of the ancient basilica architecture;
had been heavy, massive, often dark; characterized by rounded arches 
- Gothic soaring; life, ethereal; all movement has an upward thrust; arches,
spires, etc.
    - Not earthbound but reaching upward -- liturgy wanted to do the sake - not
    remain restrained by earthly concerns, but to become more spiritual, more
    mysterious, less mundane
    - High vaulted ceilings to lift one's eyes/mind upward toward God
    - **Principle of cumulation** -- Gothic heaping up or arches, decorationsl
    ornament

#### I can't be bothered

#### Position of the Altar
From the 6th century onward, the placement of the altar connected to the wall of
the apse appears with increasing frequency
- Has roots at shrine altars of the graves of martyrs
- by 1000, all the altars in Rome were in this position, except the most ancient
basilicas, where the original arrangement was retained
- by 1100, altars were adored with candles and a crucifix
    - in the Gothic period, there were also artistic innovation of polyptych
    retables, "wing-altars"

In this period, however, the meaning of Eastward orientation begins to decline
first in awareness and then in practice, as churches begin to proliferate the
number of altars or be built according to geographical position (especially
Mendicants)

History shows both positions are legitimate

#### Liturgical music
7th century, Gregory the Great had established roots of Gregorian Chant
- by 9th century, harmony had been introduced

By 12th century, polyphony introduced; began as elaboration of traditional chant
melodies; included notation
- As with other forms of art, 12th and 13th centuries had a great flourishing of
music
- Unified mass settings appear

By 14th century, organs found everywhere in the west, accompanying chant and
other music

#### Religious Orders: Mendicants
Cluny and monasticism 
- in 11th and 12th centuries, Cluny dominated
- Enjoyed confidence of popes, also stressed personal spiritual life, the choir
office, and the splendor of solemnity
- In later middle ages, the influence of Cluny greatly declined; began to
choke on its own power and wealth which would discredit it
- Mendicant orders in ascendancy

Dominicans
- Grew greatly by combating Albigensianism 
- Because they traveled, they had a great influence on the people; more so than
Cluny
    - Had to travel to Cluny, but the Dominicans came to you~!
- Had their own liturgical usages; more suitable to travel than the elaborate
celebrations in the monastic church
