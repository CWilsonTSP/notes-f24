## 2024-10-14

### Overview
- Historical context and popes
- Liturgical books
- Added Solemnity
- Development of the *Missarum Sollemnia*

#### Historical Context
Social disintegration of the Roman empire

Repeated barbarian invasions
- 410 XXX

Political organization went from unity and peace to fragmentation and a
multitude of realms ruled by warring barbarian chieftains 
- Cities looted and burned; populations dispersed, economy returned to being
principally rural with small villages

Church and episcopacy took on functions of temporal rule; sometimes the only
authority in a  region was ecclesiastical
- Especially true for the popes 

#### Three Great Lights
##### 1. St. Leo the Great (d. 461 AD)
Advanced and consolidated influence of the Holy See (sede)

His leadership, decrees, and central government in Church counteracted general
disorder

Persuaded the Huns to leave Rome; received concessions from the Vandals
> Not at the Council of Caldedon; was busy keeping Attila the Hun from sacking
> Rome

##### 2. St. Gelasius (d. 496 AD)
Upheld the primacy of the Roman See against Constantinople

Wrote letters regarding Arianism, Pelagianism, and Manichaeism

Introduced Eastern forms of prayers (ie. Litany)
> source of the Kyrie

##### 3. St. Gregory the Great (d. 604)
Had been a monk, so knew monastic liturgy and music; representative to court of
Constantinople so knew the Eastern liturgy

He concluded peace with the Lombards and resisted Byzantine attempts to usurp
power, both political and religious

Sent St. Augustine to England; brought under Roman authority in a balanced way;
did the same with Spain, Gaul, and Northern Italy (Letters 8.37)

Known as an outstanding pastor and dedicated bishop whose personal influence
kept a degree of cohesion in the Church

First pope to take direct, overall role in the liturgy
- Significantly shaped and solidified the Roman liturgy, which made it
influential and imitated

#### Development of Liturgical Books
5th and 6th century fostered the development of books

Previously no books, only scrolls
- Difficult to locate information 
- page system developed
- books invented -- passage from *volumen* to the *codex* 

Previously, improvisation was the rule which became a concern for many bishops,
regarding right doctrine and appropriateness 
- Eg. Augustine was not pleased with his clergy's improvisations

Invention of books made Liturgical standardization possible
- Attempts were made to preserve the best texts as regards orthodoxy and quality

Earliest prayers were said *ex tempore*  but even in Hippolytus we see the
beginning of a written pattern; soon many different books appear
- *Apostolus*  -- lessions from the Epistles
- *Evangelium*  -- Gospels with capitualries, that is, indexes and catalogs of the
sections of the Bible
- *Schola Cantorum*  -- music for scholas, no melody notes
- *Cantatorium*  -- music for responsorial cantors
- *Libelli*  -- "little books" with the prayers for a particular mass, e.g
- collects and prefaces
*Ordines*  -- guides to describe ceremonies in greater detail; includes first
line and rubric; not developed until later (end of 7th century)

#### Sacramentaries
Bear the names of the influcential popes, but it is unclear if all of it is from
each man.

**Leonine** -- amy have included some maniuscripts from Pope St. Leo, but was
compiled are 540, also called Veronese Sacramentary
- a collection of *Libelli*; no real organization; prayers only; no directions.
Changeable prayers; celebrant was expected to have ordinary prayers (including
the Canon) memorized; mainly for papal ceremonies, alter adapted for presbyters.
Not very functional, and so was quickly replaced

**Gelasian**  -- formed during the reign of Pope St. Gelasius and attributed to
him
- to for papal liturgies, but for priests, perhaps for titular churches; oldest
liturgical books with feats arranged according to the liturgical year; traces of
Gallican tradition attributed to Pope Gelasius

**Gregorian** -- attributed to and likely prodded by St. Gregory by 595;
developed and finalized form 630-790.
- for papal ceremonies: feast days and stational masses; XXX

#### Development in Solemnity
As the popes and bishops became more significant in temporal society, there was
an increasing solemnity accorded first to them and then to liturgy in general
- Chant
    - Litanies and ornate melodies too difficult to be sung by the entire people
    were sung by a schola, although responses were still said or sung by all
    - Gregorian chant, if not developed by Pope Gregory to its current form,
    certainly has roots in the liturgical music he standardized
- elaborate processions

#### Solemn entrance
This is a lot... we can copy it later XXX

#### Readings
XXX copy it later lmao 

#### Homily
Disappearance of the Homily -- once a normal part of the liturgy began to
disappear for three possible reasons:
- no catechumens -- instruction did not seem as necessary when all adults had
been brought up from infancy in the Church
- Time factor -- in Gregory's time when the homily was till present, masses could
run up to three hours; never a problem of the east; we see the Roman mind at
work in wanting to eliminate length and complexity, strive for brevity
- size of churches -- as buildings became larger and larger to accommodate
larger populations, it was simply impossible to hear; preaching is useless if it
is not heard. 
    - much of the Mass became silent as well -- simple reality influencing
    liturgical development

#### catechumens and prayers of the faithful
Elimination of the dismissal of the Catechumens
- liturgy of the Eucharist originally began after the dismissalr
- By this time, majority of adults in society were already baptized
- Catechumenate disappeared; replaced by infant baptismal rites almost
exclusively; no longer a need to dismiss them

Disappearance of the Prayers of the Fatihful
- related to the disappearance of the dismissal and the difficulties of the
invariable Roman form
- Probably eliminated by Pope Gelasius
- In the West, petitions had disappeared completely and litany replaced by the
*kyrie* by the reign of Pope Gregory

#### Our Father and Kiss of Peace
Movement of Our Father
- Had varied places in liturgies
- was the close of the prayers of the faithful
- began to be used before Communion as Communion preparation

Officially placed immediately after the Canon by St. Gregory, who made it and
the embolism a standard

Because the kiss of peace typically followed the Our Father, this was moved as
well

#### Offertory 
xxx I can't be bothered right now

#### Consecration
xxx I can't be bothered right now

> embolism -- extension of a previously composed piece ("deliver us O Lord, we
> pray, from every evil...")

#### Fraction
xxx I can't be bothered right now

#### Communion
xxx I can't be bothered right now

> People leaving mass early is of ancient origin

#### Communion and kinds
xxx I can't be bothered right now

#### Shift to Communion under one Kind
Over time, the chalice was no longer received by the people in the West in the
East, intinction became the practice (local council of Baraga Portugal 675
forbade intinction)
- **Practical difficulties** -- quantities of wine necessary for thousands of
communicants became a practical problem; also, availability of wine in northern
countries, where it had to be imported
- **Ecclesial Authority** -- Church has authority to regulate these concerns;
accepted that if a priest consumed the precious blood, it was sufficient to
fulfill the Lord's precept at the Last Supper
    - "take this, all of you, and eat of it" addressed to the Apostles, the
    first priests

#### Concluding Rite
XXX add later

#### *Missarum Sollemnia* 
Overarching dimensions of this Roman liturgy in the late 500s and 700s compared
to the 300s and 400s.
- There is a magnificent completeness in this
- It is a great community exercise (each station) and carries the splendor of
tradition
- it has absorbed elements of the count and is fulled out even in small detail
- the remarkable pomp is suddenly quieted when the Canon begins and does not
return until it is over
- Prayers and singing become the art function of a small group who is connected
to the altar yet still sound in, Latin, the language of the people
