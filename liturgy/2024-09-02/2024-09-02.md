#### Religious Meals
> We will look at the time of the Maccabees through the destruction

There was a broad intensification on the part of the Jews to be faithful to
their ancestral Religious traditions and observances
- Different schools of through, ex Pharisees, Sadducees, and the Essenes
- Jewish sources at the time witness to a varied religious situation

The religious practices of this time should be taken seriously for the study of
Christian Liturgy
- Jesus, Paul, Apostles == Jews
- Organic relationship between the faith and worship of Judaism and early
Christianity

#### Jewish Sources 
*The Dead Sea Scrolls*
- Manuscripts copied between 200 BC and 70 AD
- Contains numerous writings from the Second Temple period
- Much on the Essenes and intact biblical texts

*Josephus* 
- Jewish historian and Pharisee from 1st century
- Important witness to Jewish history and culture at the time of Jesus and the
early Church
- HOWEVER, Josephus politically betrayed his people to work for the Roman courts

*Mishnah*
- Extensive collection of the oral traditions of Jewish rabbis from 50 BC to 200
AD
- Most of these tradtions are focused on legal and Liturgical matters
- For Rabbinic Judaism (Judaism of the rabbis), the Mishnah remains the most
authoritative witness to Jewish Tradition outside of the Bible itself

*Targums* 
- Ancient translations and paraphrases of the Bible from Hebrew into Aramaic
- After the Babylonian Exciel (587 BC)

#### The temple and religious meals

- God's precense dwelt here and through it he Jewish people coul dlive their
command [[ Lev 19#2 | "You shall be holy, as I, the Lord your God, is Holy" ]].

the bond between the temple and the early Church was naturual
- Jesus frequented the temple for the Major Jewish feasts
    - as a child for the Passiver
    - called the temple his "Father's house", taught there and associated it
    with his body
- At the [[ Luke 24#53 | end of Luke's gospel]], the epostles were continually in
the temple praising and blessing God and in Acts he refers to, [[ Acts 2#46 | "Attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes"]]

#### Religious Meals of the Jewish Communities
One of the most important ways that the Jews during the time of Jesus sought to
live their religious piety, modeled in the temple, was through eating and
drinking in common

Because of the Dead Sea Scrolls and other Jewish sources, we have a number of
witnesses to these religious Communities and meals
- Yahad
- Essenes
- Therapeutae
- [C]haburah
- Todah

#### Yahad
Hebrew word for community, union, or "that which is one"

They appear to be a community who settled at Qumran and dwelt on shores around
the dead sea until 68 AD when captured by Rome

Though somewhat distinct from the writings of other Essenes they are often
identified with them and are certainly part of the  "Essene movement"

##### Characteristics
**Covenant** 
- regarded itself as "the Covenant with God"

**membership requirements**
- Separation from in justice and wickedness
    -  echos of ancient catechumens?
- Passing through water to "cross over into the covenant"
- Probationary period until instructed in purity rules, ritual ablutions,
knowledge of hierarchical structure

**hierarchical** 
- Priests ranked first, Levites next, then laity

**Temple**
- Yahad is explicitly spoken of as a temple, connected to heaven and the angels,
which offered deeds of thanksgiving
- Paul: Christ's body, the Church, is a temple

**Military and priestly significance** 

##### Meals
XXX

**regulations** 
- A priest must be present at the meal and utter one or more blessings before it
- [[ Lev 24#5 | "They shall prepare the table"]] which is technical language used for the table
of the Bread of the Presence

#### Essenes
Testimony of Josephus:
XXX

#### Therapeutae

Description and excultation of the Therapeutae form Philo of Alexandria (20 BC
to 50 AD)
- From the Egyptian disaspora
- Therapeutae -- "worshippers" or "healers"
- Asceticism

They esteemed the Sabbath as holy and a festival and celebrated it with a simple
meal of bread, salt, hyssop, and water
- Philo comments XXX

Their great annual meal was linked to Israel's redemption from Egypt
- Before the meal was eaten, the Scriptures had been expounded and a hymn had
been sung, then was brought in the table
- The meal was modeled on the temple ritual of the Bread of the Presence
- was followed XXX

#### Chaburah 
literally "friend"; named used for
1. a group of Jews who formed a religious fellowship
2. the manner of their fellowship
3. the weekly meal shared on the eve of Sabbaths or Holy days

Characteristics
- Understood themselves as an associated of God's covenant family
- Had the goal of strict observance of ritual cleanness and seemed to have
dimension of study

Admittance
- Those seeking admittance to a Chaburah were required to undergo instruction
and were examined on their competence of purity laws
- Among various groups of Jews, it is probable that around the time of Jesus,
some Pharisees too formed into these groups

#### Summary
XXX

#### Todah
##### Scriptural Foundation:
- [[Lev 7#11]]-14
- form of peace offering
- Todah -- thanksgiving sacrifice
- "This sacrifice is in the category of *zēbaḣ* " XXX

##### Historical
This sacrifice, rooted in the OT was a prominent ritual meal in the time of
Jesus and a rite of central importance in Jewish thought
- XXX

Historical context and situation of a todah offering
- offered when an Israelite was delivered from the experience of suffering
sickness or potential death
- Ratzinger The Feast of Faith pg 55

##### Ritual
sacrificial animal and both unleavened and leavened bread
- the one "deliverde" would offer these for himself, his friends, and the
community celebrating the beginning of his new existence

Two essential parts:
1. Verbal -- a public proclamation or confession of thanksgiving for divine
   deliverance
   - connected to the cup of wine included in the sacrificial meal
2. meal itself
    - all consumed the animal offering, breads, and wine indicating their
    communion with God and one another
    - the only sacrifice in which leavened bread is offered
    - the only time when consecrated bread was eaten by lay Israelites

##### Theological
Psalms -- certain Psalms are identified as Todah Psalms
- [[ Ps 22 ]] -- stunning Psalm of deliverance and thanksgiving

Interiorization
- XXX
- The one whose life is delivered, offers, as it were, his own suffering and
certain death from which he is delivered

Connection to the Last supper
- The Last Supper anticipated his suffering
- Jesus offers a thanksgiving sacrifice

Whereas the Last Supper anticipated Jesus' redemptive death and resurrection,
the Eucharist celebrates its realization.
