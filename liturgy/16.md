# Franco-Germanic Influences and Beginning of the Gothic Period

## 2024-10-21

### Overview
#### Liturgical Contributions of the Franco-Germanic Rites

### Holy Silence
The Franco-Germanic emphasis on silence originates from:
- a re-reading of Scripture, especially the Old Testament produced suggestions
for liturgy, e.g. "The Lord is in his holy temple; let all the world keep
silence before him" (Habbakuk 2:20)
- In Franco-Germanic Pagan culture, sacred rites were done in silence as a sign
of the sacred
- With this cultural background and the support of the Christian Scriptures,
silence became an important part of the rite, especially at the holiest moments
(like the consecration)
- Likewise, larger churches and a decreased understanding of Latin greatly
contributed to praying the anaphora quietly

By the 9th century, a silence anaphora became the custom
- **Note** -- increasingly, people observed the Mass; became more and more the
province of the priest; the people's experience of the liturgy (not so much
ecclesial life) was much more individual than communal

#### Devotions at Mass
Devotions at Mass begin to replace participation in Mass
- As music became more and more complex, people could no longer sing it as it
took a trained choir
- Since they could no longer sing the Mass, and they could not hear the priest,
other forms of participation developed
    - Vernacular hymns, tropes, and sequences were sung, while the clergy prayed
    the Latin
    - Detailed allegory was taught and written but often with a limited
    connection
    to the meaning of liturgical actions
    - In time, devotional allegory, private devotions, separate texts for the
    laity, renaissance concerns eventually became the norm; none of these
    however were directly part of the action of the Mass
- **Note** -- This gave the impression that clergy and laity were no longer
engaging in one common act of worship, but two different acts occurring
simultaneous -- this is an important shift with long-range consequences

#### Allegory
Because the words were mainly inaccessible, external movements, symbolism
(Gallican delight), liturgical actions, and dramatic gestures communicated more
than texts

**Alamar of Metz** (around 800 AD) -- Devised a system  of devotional allegory
for every part of the Mass; attributed a symbolic meaning to every action of the
Mass, relating to the life of Christ, his passion, and Death
- This allegorical movement became extensive in detail and each writer's system
would be distinct from another's (different allegories)
- Though resisted by some and even condemned at the synod of Quiercy, allegory
took root

> [!NOTE]
> Allegories had *a good catechetical purpose* in conveying the Gospel and
mysteries of Christ's life but were not liturgical in the proper sense of the
term
> - They attempted to involve the people, but it was not involvement in the Mass
> *per se* 
> - Mass perceived as a series of symbols, rather than direct participation in
>   the Paschal Mystery

#### Reverence and Awe
Frankish liturgy emphasized the mystical and mysterious

OT images of the temple influenced common consciousness of liturgy
- The priest was like the High Priest entering the Holy of Holies, more than the
presbyter of the baptized leading them in divine worship
- As the priest was seen as the man of the 'holy', there arose a greater sense
of separation between the priest and the people

Deeper emphasis on God coming to earth, rather than the assembly being raised to
heaven in the liturgy.
- Shift from *eucharistia*  to *bona gratia* , the climatic moment of which is t
the consecration, when Christ descends from God to us.

As Mass centered more on ritual actions of the priest, a concealment in decorum,
silent prayers, and architecture was added to enhance a sense of mystery
- Curtains drawn around the altar
- Rood screens separated altar from the people: separation of roles became an
architectural feature (ie. choir stalls)
- Silent prayers wrapped all the gestures of the priest

Personal holiness became a chief emphasis for the priest as well as the people
which lessened the former emphasis on the community of the redeemed
- All society was nominally Christian, profound awareness of sin to the point of
excess, disturbing examples of clergy's unholiness, deep emphasis on reverence
lead to a proliferation of *apologiae*

#### Apologiae
Personal avowals of guilt and unworthiness on the part of the celebrant; usually
of considerable length
- Private prayers of the priest
- Penitential in character emphasized the priest's unworthiness and sinfulness;
often included prayers for humility and purity
- Accompanied virtually action in the liturgy: vesting of the priest, Beginning
of mass, kissing the altar, between readings, incensing, washing of hands,
preparation of the gifts, before the canon, commingling and commixture, before
communion to name a few
- Reached a peak in the 11th century but were quickly reduced thereafter due to
a greater doctrinal clarity on sin and forgiveness and more frequent use of the
sacrament of confession, instead of once a year

**Penitential Rite** -- *apologiae* are the origin of the Penitential Rite
- Psalm 42 recited on the way to the altar developed into the prayers at the
foot of the altar and the *Confiteor* 

#### Communion Practices
Shift to unleavened bread (900sPractives)
- Had always been usd in some places (eg. Armenian tradition)
- Increased reverence and focus on the Body of Christ, greater concern about
particles, and a new emphasis on reservation found a resolution with unleavened
bread
- Alcuin, advisor to Charlemagne, promoted this practice
- Greater tensions with the East solidified this practice

Communion given under only one species
- Inaccessibility of wine in northern climate
- Difficulty and expense of getting large quantities of wine
- Danger of spilling
- Western rejection of intinction 

Around 878, communion on the tongue replaces communion in the hand
- especially as a reaction to some 9th century Eucharistic controversies in
which the Real Presence was denied

Around the same time, kneeling begins
- Practical -- easier to administer on the tongue if people are kneeling
- Spiritual -- kneeling was a Frankish sign of fealty and humility in presence
of the king now applied to Christ
- Communion rails for kneeling then became the common practice

As these practices Increased, frequency of reception unfortunately decline

#### Prayer Postures
Rome had and maintained the *orans* position from the earliest times of
Christianity

Northern countries had a custom of folding hands as a sign of homage, and a
gesture of humility and obedience
- This became the standard in the feudal system and was used for feudal oaths

Both came to be used at Mass
- *orans*  for the principal prayers
- Joined hands for the private prayers

#### Creed 
First introduced in the East in the 6th century, after preparation of the gifts

Brought to Gaul as an aid against Arianism and promoted by Charlemagne

Though not a Roman tradition, in 1014 Emperor Henry II order Pope Benedict VIII
(d. 1024) to follow the Franco-Germanic custom and put the Creed into the
liturgy, because it had been been said at this coronation Mass

Rome accepted its used following the Gospel for Sundays and Solemnities 

#### Liturgical Cycle
Sunday Calendar largely took shape as we have now
- Instead of ordinary time, there were "Sundays after Epiphany" and "Sundays
After Pentecost"

By 800 the Sunday readings were set -- same in Rome until 1970

St. Martin of Tours was the first non-martyr saint to be included on the
Calendar
