What is interesting to me about the early liturgies is how quickly the apostles
accepted a new form of offering replicated them. They evolve of course, as our
mass has over the centuries, but it seems to be a quick turn around from what
the apostles were used to. God had been providentially guiding the evolution of
the Jewish worship to culminate in this, but the fulfillment of it, going from
offering "bread and wine" to offering "body and blood" mixes the table ritual
and the temple ritual, which must have been novel.
