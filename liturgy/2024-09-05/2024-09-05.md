#### Was the Last Supper a Passover?
Cabie asks this

The Gospels connect the Last Supper and the Passion to the Passover.
- [[Matt 26#19]]
- [[Mark 14#14]]-16
- [[Luke 22#15]]
- [[John 13#1]]
- [[John 18#28]]ff

So, they are undoubtedly connected
> Passover was going from slavery to freedom

#### Calendar Questions
All four agree that Jesus died on Friday before sundown which begins the
Sabbath, but they do not agree on when the Passover occurred,
- Synoptic Tradition
-   Explicit: Last Supper occurred at the Jewish Passover and was a Passover
meal
- Johannine Tradition
- indicates that Jesus was crucified at the very time the Passover lambs were
being slaughtered in preparation for the Passover that evening, [[John 18#28]]
[[John 19#14]] 

"How can Jesus have celebrated the Passover before his crucifixion when the
Passover did not begin until several hours after his death?"
- Common but insufficient ways of dealing with this problem:
    1. Jesus did not celebrate a Passover. Scholars suggest that it was a
       Chabrrah
    2. John was making a theological point and not concerned about historical
       detail; though scholars today hold that John is the *most*  historical
       and chronological of the four Gospels
       > *The Testimony of the Beloved Disciple*, 

Hypotheses:
1. Temple Calendar
    - Lunar calendar whereby the Passover would fall on Friday evening
2. Essene calendar
    - Solar calendar with fixed dates whereby the Passover would always be a
    Tuesday evening

The idea is that Jesus celebrated the Passover Seder Meal according the Essene
calendar and John was referring to the Temple calendar

Historically there were these two calendars

The Gospels have some connection with the practices of the Essenes
- Their asceticism, which John seems to have adopted, their practice of celibacy,
which Mary vowed ([[Luke 1#34]]) 
- We find details in the Synoptics: Luke says Jesus told Peter and John to
prepare the Passover. [[Luke 22#10]]
    - It was common that a woman carried the water jar (not a man), except for
    the Essenes

The traditional site of the Last Supper, the Cenacle, is an Essene quarter of
Jerusalem

This theory helps cease the complication of the timeline between the Last Supper
and the crucifixion
- Jesus was taken before Annas [[John 18#13]]f, Caiaphas [[John 18#24]], the
Sanhedrin [[Luke 22#66]]f, Herod [[Luke 23#6]]f, and Pontius Pilate [[John 18#27]]

Ancient sources say that last Supper was on a Tuesday (*Didiscalia*)

Maintains the theological richness of John; Jesus was killed when the lambs were
being slaughtered sowing the parting of the Old Covenant from the New

This theory shows that it was indeed a Passover that Jesus celebrated.

> Pascal Theory: John is referring to a preparation for the Sabbath, and John
> called it the Passover because it was happening that week

### Jewish Passover
**Sedar Meal** -- from the Hewbrew for "order"
- Main sources: Mishnah and Tosefta
- unfolded according to liturgical form
- organized around four cups
    - wine mandatory even for the poor
- We have only reconstructed this from historical sources

**Introductory Ceremony** -- Began in the evening, the father would gather the
family at a large table and recline (sign of freedom from slavery)

#### First cup
Cup of Sanctification -- (ki-ddush)
- Passover meal would begin with the pouring, mixing, and drinking of the first
cup of win
- Typical prayer over the first cup: "Blessed are you, o Lord our God, Kind of
the universe, who creates the fruit of the vine"  (Mishnah, Berakoth, 6:1)
    - Origin of mass offertory prayers
- Food brought to the table
    - Preliminary meal began with bitter herbs, unleavened bread (recalled the
    bitterness of Egypt)

#### Second cup
Cup of Proclamation
- the father would "proclaim" what God had done for his people in Egypt and mix
the second cup
- the youngest would ask what makes this night different
    - then father reads scripture and exclaims the passages and the Passover
    - Theological meaning -- each person at the meal participated in the actual
    Exodus itself and its redemption
- In praise of this all would sing the Hallel (praise) Psalms: [[Ps 113]] and
[[Ps 114]]; all responded 'hallelujah' after each half verse
    - these Psalms and the drinking of the cup ended the second part of the
    Seder

#### Third cup
Cup of Blessing
- Third cup signals the beginning of the actual supper
- Meal begins when father takes bread, breaks it, and said a blessing and
passes it around:
    - "Blessed are you Lord god, who brings forth bread from the Earth"
    - then Pascal Lamb eaten without ritual
- after the meal, father takes the cup, offer a prayer, and all drink
- then second set of Hallel psalms XXX finish

#### fourth cup
Cup of Praise or Consummation (Hallel)
- The last of Hallel psalms sung 
    - [[Ps 118]] -- The great Hallel
    - This psalm was a sacrifice of thanksgiving, so it is also a *Todah* Psalm
- then fourth cup drank
    - Forbidden to drink between the third and fourth cups (Mishnah)
    - finished the Seder meal

### Passover and the Gospels
#### Correspondances with the Gospels
Luke mentions two cups
- second cup [[Luke 22#17]]
    - After this, he speaks of the meaning of the meal "This is my body which is
    given "
    - Jesus replaces the Jewish words ("see the bread of misery which was eaten
    by our fathers who passed out of Egypt")
        - If the apostles celebrated the Passover every year, they would be
        familiar and know the change
- third cup [[Luke 22#20]]
    - Paul says "blessing cup" ([[1 Cor 11#16]]) "after supper" ([[1 Cor 11#25]])
    - Prayer associated with this cup included thanksgiving for the land,
    liberation from Egypt, and the *covenant* (Jesus replaces these words again)
    (Talud, Midrash)

Matthew, Mark, and Luke refer to Jesus' vow: "I shall not drink of the fruit of
the vine until the kingdom of God comes" (Could not drink between the third and
fourth cups)

Matthew and Mark say Jesuss disciples sing a hymn at the end of the mean

All say they did not finish the meal

#### Correspondances after the Last Supper
Sup of Suffering -- [[Mark 14#36]]

Fourth Cup on the Cross before his death
    - he would not drink the wine wixed with gall before his suffering was
    complete ([[Matt 27#34]]; [[Mark 15#23]])
    - then he did take of the fruit of the vine ([[Mark 15#36]])

[[John 19#23]]-[[John 19#30]]
- He asks then consummates the Passover cup at the moment of his death

This unites the passover with his death and Resurrection

Pascal Mystery
- Pietre "By waiting to drink the fourth cup... until the very moment of his
death, Jesus united the Last Supper, to his death on the cross"
- it is the Passover Seder meal which gives the crucifixion itself a liturgical
nature
- "At the Last Supper, Jesus not only looked back to the Jewish history of
salvation... He also looked forward to his own passion and death. By doing so, he
deliberately tied his actions over the bread and wine at the lat Supper to both
the history of redemption and his own 'exodus' that he was to accomplish in
Jerusalem." (Pietre) 

### Apostolic Eucharist and the Gospels

While there are correspondences, why are the accounts so limited on details and
where are there differences in the accounts?

The apostolic Eucharist which the apostles would have performed following
Pentecost was *not* a Passover 
- the Passover did *not* become the context of fulfilling Jesus' words
- This would be against the Jewish law which was still practiced by the Apostles

The accounts contain few details concerning the ceremonial of the meal, because
this was not meant to be the lasting setting of the celebration (Jung, 7)
- The Chaburah and the Tordah were the contexts in which the first apostolic
Eucharists were celebrated

The apparent differences between these accounts arouse from the differences in
the liturgical practice from which they accounts come (Jung, 7-8) 

Different apostolic traditions
1. Paul/Luke
2. Matthew/Mark

Luke and Paul seem very clear that an agape meal occurred between the
consecration of the bread and wine

Matthew and mark make no mention of a meal be teem Jesus' actions

It may be that the liturgy celebrated where Matthew and Mark wrote already
joined the two actions/consecrations (that is, taken out of the context of a
meal)
