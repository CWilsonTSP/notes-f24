### Overview
Until well into the middle ages, there were two distinct Western liturgical
families
- generally tended to precision, sobriety, relative brevity, and comparative
simplicity
- except in Rome (Greek), they developed into the vernacular (Latin) and
continued, in part, because Latin was the only written, literary language

Roman (liturgical center of the wet)
- Rome 
- North African

Gallic
- Gallican (Gaul proper)
- Celtic XXX

#### North African
Latin Became the liturgical language at the end of the second century

No complete text of the African Mass, only extend scattered references

> Rome resisted Latin liturgy and adopted it last

Closely coincided with the Roman Mass 

Distinguishing factors:
- use of Latin
- Rail surrounds the altar for communion
- common name for the Eucharist in North Africa: "*offerre* " and "*Sacrificari* "
- Regular, eve daily, offerings of the faithful to the Church (breads, wines,
etc.)

#### Gallican
Used in Frankish realm (France/Germany) during the middle ages
- shows a remarkable independence and distinctiveness
- disappeared by the 8th century
- extend is the text *Missale Gothicum* (sacramentary)

Composed of a series of individual prayers, even for the Eucharist prayer,
instead of one continuous anaphora
- The whoel series of each of these prayers are subject to variationsl ex: every
feast of the Lord and a Saint's feast had distinctive formularies
- some formulas could be used any time
- No apostolic or patriarchal center
    - Juridical -- excessive diversity of forms

Did not endure, but mingled with and gave way to the Roman Rite in the 8th
century

##### liturgy of the Word
began with a four-prt sequence
- psalmody which accompanied the entrace
- the bishop's greeting, followed by singing the trisagion
- kyrie, sung by three boys
- followed by the Benedictus and a concluding prayer

liturgy of the Word with three readings:
1. OT and Canticle of the three young men in the furnace, with a responsorial
   chant
2. Acts or XXX

Solemn procession, understood as the triumphal procession of Christ; clergy Cary
the offering gifts to the altar which had been offered by the people before Mass

An opening address called *missa* which is like a preface; expands specific
themes according to the particular feast
- Reading of the diptychs (names of living and dead) with names of those for who
the Mass is offered
- closes with the prayer followed by the kiss of peace

Eucharistic Prayer -- follows

The breaking of bread had regulations and an accompanying antiphonal chant
-  variable prayer that leads into the Our Father, which was said by the entire
assembly
- deacon invites all to receive a blessing according to each feast

Holy Communion accompanied by chanting Ps. 33
- Mass concluded with an oration

This liturgy had a learning towards splendor and ceremony; its rhetorical style
was ornamental and diffuse and often faded in and out of being an address and a
prayer; theological content and structures reflected the constant upheavals and
controversies

#### Celtic
Latin liturgies among the Celtic people of Northwest Europe, especially Scotland
and Ireland
- Few extent liturgical documents
- the chief promoters were the Scottish and Irish monks who took many
pilgrimages
and missionary johnnies
- Eg. St, Brendan

"The liturgy reveals the char XXX"

#### Mozarabic
Also known as the old Spanish rite, derives its name form the time of the Muslim
conquest of Spain
- still exists today, but only in the cathedral of Toledo
- Used after Spain came under Arab control after 711

Distinguishing elements
- Breaking of bread into 9 parts for the mysteries of Christ's life. As piece is
broken off, the priest pronounces the respective mystery of Christ
    - Incarnation, Nativity, circumcision, epiphany, passion, death,
    resurrection, glorification, reign
    - theological -- the entire mystery of Christ's life is made present
    - "He was made known in the breaking of the bread"
- Amen after each line of the Lord's prayer

#### Milanese
Also known as the Ambrosian rite
- still exists in the archdiocese of Milan
- is permeated with Roman forms, particularly the Roman Canon itself
- developed form the 4th century, attributed to St. Ambrose
    - Ambrose perhaps adapted the liturgy in view of the Arian controversy
    - Pastoral development -- developed liturgy of his in its arrangement of
    psalms and hymns "after the manner of the Orientals, lest the people should
    languish in cheerless monotony"

Distinguishing Elements:
- Blessing of the reading  -- underscores the salvific power of the scriptures
- Order -- kiss of peace, preparation of gifts, Creed, prayer over the gifts
- anaphoras -- two proper Eucharistic prayers in addition to the Roman Canon
    - one of which has the epiclesis after the words of institution
    - Numerous prefaces
