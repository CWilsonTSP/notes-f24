The efficacy of the sacrament comes from God himself, not the x of the minister
- Augustine, SSC

#### Mysterium
Term used by the Romans to describe the oriental cults, in which they included
Christianity
- Mystery religions were secret societies into which only the initiates gained
knowledge
- Christians were lumped together with these cults (Justin Martyr vigorously
refuted this)
- There was a dimensions of secrecy in the Christian liturgy but this developed
because of persecution and was maintained to avoid the contempt of the
uninitiated (disciplina arcani)
- Justin Martyr also defends the simplicity of what happens in the Eucharist,
as something coming from light rather than darkness

Mystery - *Mysterium* (Latin) musterion (Greek) came to have a deep significance
in both the East and the West

OT and NT - "secret" which is "revealed, manifest, made known to those with
faith; to those without faith they are confusing, bewildering"
- Septuagint (LXX) uses the term to mean "secret;" nearly always has religious
and regulatory overtone, e.g. Vision of Nebuchadnezzar in Dan 2:18-30
    - Daniel helped interpret Nebuchadnezzar's dream, Christ bringing forth his
    kingdom
- NT has similar meaning but now associated with God's plan in Christ, e.g. Eph
1:9, 3:3; Rev 1:20
    - Paul specifically connects mystery to Christ

We're talking about the paschal mystery when talking about the mystery of Christ
- Pasch is the Passover
- in OT, Exodus from Egypt
- in NT, Passion, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Lord, it is "the
mystery of faith" proper, the supreme mystery of faith which has been ordained
since the beginning of the world and spoken of the in scriptures
- paschal mystery first appears in writings of St. Melito of Sardis (200s)
- Tertullian and the Vulgate use the word *sacramentum* instead

Eventually, *mysterium*  tended to refer to the spiritual realities hidden
beneath the external forms, while *sacramentum*  emphasized the actions which
contained the mysteries (cf. CCC 1075)
- Sacrament came to be understood as the external realities

In Latin, *Sacramentum*  tended to replace *liturgia*  and *mysterium*  which
were Greek in origin

#### What is the liturgy?
The liturgy is the Paschal Mystery
- In the liturgy, CHristy acts through the power of the HS; His Passion, Death,
Resurrection, and Glorification through which the work of our redemption is
accomplished is made present (SC7)
    - This is the plan of the ages, revealed in Christ, and continued now until the
    end of time

The liturgy is the offering of the people of God
- in union with Christ and the spitir we participate in His offering in a
foretaste of heaven (CCC 1090)
- already offered to the father, but continued even now

The liturgy is the sacred actions and words (rituals, rites, worship) that make
the paschal mystery present
- Action of Christ in union with members of His Body; action of the Church in
union with Christ, the head (CCC 1140)
    - Augustine -- highlighting "the whole Christ" -- Christ's head and members,
    as one mystical body 

What is the effect of this participation?
- sanctification, Glorification in heaven, evangelical work for the world,
strength and outpouring if life for the whole church

#### Constituents of the liturgy
That is, what is properly liturgical?
1. The Mass ("Divine Liturgy" in the East) ()
    - Principally the Mass
2. the rites of the sacraments(SC 7: "When anybody baptizes it really is Christ
   himself who baptizes./")
    - ll Sacraments are actions of Christ in union with his people
3. Liturgy of the Hours
4. Church/Liturgical Year: living out in time of the whole mystery of redemption
5. Funeral Rites: express the eschatological faith of the Church in the
   fulfillment of redemption for each individual
6. Sacramentals (*popular piety is distinct from but related to the liturgy)
    - Eg. Giving a blessing is a liturgical act

### Dimensions of the liturgy
*Sacrosanctum Concillium*  (16) outlines 5 major aspects/dimensions/realities/
of the liturgy
- Historical
- theological
- spiritual
- pastoral
- juridical


#### historical dimension
The liturgy as it developed in history (primary emphasis of this course)

Week seek to:
- understand the "why" of development, its causes and the effects
- perceive how the HS is at work in every period
    - Because the HS is the primary animator of the Church, always the HS who
    leads us
- Gain a proper perspective on, learn from, and appreciate each liturgical period

#### Theoloigcal dimension
the revealed meaning of the liturgy: CHristis presence and power
in the liturgy (cf. SC 7)
- How does liturgy reflect the Church's theologoy (lex orandi, lex credendi)
- Liturgy as Catechesis/theology - what does it teach?
- How adequately does liturgy transmit faith in different periods/traditions

#### Spiritual dimension
In harmony with the action of the HS (DD 49)
- The whole reason for the liturgy is redmeptiona and sacntification
- Liturgy is spiiritual worship (Rom 12:1 "logike latreia")
    - Active participation by all the faithful -  active engament of heart and
    mind; *actuosa* implies deep interior participation, not only external
    - Priest myst be a worshiper too; never just a "presider"
        - The priest takes an active role in leading the faithful in their
        worship of the one true God

#### pastoral dimension
Applying theological and spiritual principles for the good of people, personally
and communally
- Leading the flock to an active, fruitful, conscious participation 
- Utilizing or accepting legitimate diversity for the good of souls (where
allowed)
- Genuine pastoral concern wants to lead people out of themselves to the truth
and love of God

#### Juridical
Laws, rubrics, norms, and the avoidance of extremes
- rigidity or scrupulous observance as more important than or the same as
reverence
- Disregard of the law or knowingly ignoring norms in the rite
- Beautiful and sanctifying worship should be our goal (rubrics and norms are
not ends but means to serve the higher reality of the Eucharistic Celebration)

## Overview of the mass itself 
- Basic structure
- Step-by-step outline


#### Basic structure
Two parts o the mass
- Joined very early
1. Liturgy of the Word
2. Liturgy of the Eucharist
- Together they form one single act of worship (SC 56)

Road to Emmaus (Lk 25:13-32)
- Reveals the connection between the two Liturgies
- Luke write his Gospel after the earliest Celebrations of "the breaking of
bread"
- happens after the first celebrations of the Liturgy

- Introductory rites
- liturgy of the word
- liturgy of the Eucharist
    - took - offertory
    - blessed - consecration
    - broke - fraction
    - gave - communion
-concluding rite

The liturgy of the Eucharist is structured according to Jesus' fourfold action
at the Last Supper
- Mk 14:22, Mt 26:26, Lk 22:19
- Also in the multiplication of the loaves, on the road to Emmaus, and in every
liturgical tradition unto today

The truth of the Last supper (something that happened) continues to happen
(this is vital in the road to Emmaus)
