## 6. Apostolic and Post-Apostolic Liturgy

#### Time Frame
Parallel with the NT (33-100 AD), but also sources outside NT
- liturgy this period was largely based on the Jewish pattern of worship from the
temple, the synagogue, and the homes
    - Liturgy of the Word from the Synagogue
    - Liturgy of the Eucharist from the four-fold action and the Jewish Chaburah or
    Todah
- included both development and some measure of diversity
    1. Joining the Word and Eucharist (form), Separation from Judaism and
       inclusion of the Greeks (influence), Sundays (time), separating of the
    agape meal (form), new locations and arrangements (place)
    2. Traditions of [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/49 - Luke/Luke]]/[[saint-paul|Paul]] and [[Matt|Matthew]]/[[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/48 - Mark/Mark]],
       apostolic centers, liturgical languages, written sources

> Didadche -- shows how the early liturgy was Jewish in form but Christian in
context

#### Historical Context of development
In this period, Christians still attended temple and synagogue
- *Temple*  -- the Apostles did not initiate a Separation from Temple worship
but practices it [[Acts 2#46]]; seeing that Christ fulfilled the Covenant with
Israel
- *Synagogue*  -- the Apostles followed the Jewish practice of reading the
scriptures and commenting on them; their commentary was the *kerygma*
(preaching)
    - This is the origin of what became the "apostolic Preaching" and the
    Liturgy of the Word
    - St. Steven

Official Judaism soon ostracized believers in Jesus as Messiah

- Christians had to develop their own forms of worship, but naturally used
Jewish, rather than pagan forms, because they saw Judaism as the Covenant and
true religion ([[Rom 9#4]]) of which Christ was the fulfillment
- Liturgy of the Word and Liturgy of the Eucharist were joined somewhat early in
this period ([[Acts 20#7]]-11)

Context of Greco-Roman Society
- Jewish roots but then the Gentiles quickly accepted Christ
> Institution of the diaconate was influenced by the Greeks
- initial problems: Gentile inclusion and Judaizers
- At first Christians were opposed only by Jewish authorities; then as the
Church grew, by Roman authorities
    - initially regarded as a Jewish sect that took practices from Judaism
    - As more Gentiles became Christian, Hellenistic influences increased (this
    became true in philosophy, theology, as well as liturgy) eg. Didache vs.
    Justin
- The destruction of the Temple in 70 AD shaped and hastened the distinction
between Jews and Christians

#### Sabbath to Sunday
Adopted and transformed the Jewish rhythm of time
- Weekly -- Sunday
- Yearly -- Feast of Easter, and eventually anniversary of martyrs
- Daily -- three set hours ([[Acts 3#1]]) and our Father three times (Didache)

Sunday replaces the Sabbath as the day of worship
> Ratzinger -- This radical shift in worship required a radical event (the Resurrection)
- The Sabbath represented the completion of the first creation, Israel's
liberation from slavery, and God's Covenant with them
- Very quickly it was replaced by Sunday which recalls the new creation,
liberation from sin and death, and Christ's new and eternal covenant all of
which was inaugurated  by Christ's Resurrection which occurred on the first
day of the week, Sunday ([[Acts 20#7]], [[Rev 1#10]])

Time of day for eucharistic celebration
- originally evenings like Seder Passover and Chaburah (next day began the
evening before)
- then mornings, which better commemorated the Resurrection
    - Contributing cause -- when meal stopped being part of the Eucharist,
    people needed to eat, so evenings became rarer
- Christ is the "Rising Sun" -- Eastward position of prayer was a Mediterranean
Jewish custom (to Jerusalem)
    - Adopted by Christians who look to the East for the Rising Sun, Christ, who
    will return (eschatological expectation)

We see this shift in [[Acts 20#7]]-8

#### Breaking of Bread
Most ancient term for the Eucharist
- *te klasei toi artou* -- was not used in typical Greek to describe an
ordinary meal and was alien to both Jewish and classical literature
    - Specifically a Christian term

Originates in the NT and links the Eucharist to Jesus' actions at the last
Supper
- **Emmaus** -- [[Luke 24#30]]-35
- **Luke's description of what characterized the early church**  -- [[Acts 2#42]],
[[Acts 2#46]]
- **Pauline Eucharistic description** -- [[1 Cor 10#16]]

#### [[saint-paul|Pauline Account]]
[[1 Cor 11#17]]-34: most extensive teaching on the breaking of the bread in the
NT (~53-54 AD)
- Biblical and historical witness to the apostolic Eucharist carried out at
Jesus' command
    - clear and unambiguous proof of the early Christian Eucharist
    - [[1 Cor 11#23]]
- Paul addresses it became of the glaring contradictions that occurred against
that Jesus instituted
    - Selfish excesses and drunkenness which abandon the spiritual character of
    the event
    - division and factions; exclusion, particularly of the poor
    - lack of awareness of Christ's body and blood

#### Agape Meal
Paul's account testifies that the meal took place between the consecrations of
the bread and wine
- ht occasion of his wiring are the abuses surrounding this meal
- he highlights "in the same way also the chalice,*after supper*"[[1 Cor 11#25]]

**Agape Meal** -- the meal eaten in the context of the Eucharist between the
consecrated bread and consecrated wine 
- [[Jude 1#12]], love feasts, *agapais* 

Early Separation
- at some point the agape meal was *distinguished* and removed from the
Eucharistic celebration
- When Matthew and Mark wrote, it must have already been customary in the
locality to put the two consecrations together without the meal (Jung. 10)

Natural Separation
- The assemblies began to grow; so, not enough space
- central was the spiritual reality of Christ's risen presence within the
consecrations of bread and wine
- transition from the Eucharist and agapge in the evening to Eucharist in the
mornings
- became principally a liturgical commemoration

Historical remnants of the agape meal
- Catacombs -- depict agape meals at the tombs of martyrs
- Hippolytus -- in the Easter liturgy the initiated received milk, honey, and
water amid their reception of the Body and Blood of Christ
- Eastern Liturgy -- still uses the Antidoron, non-consecrated blessed bread

#### Location of the Eucharist
Homes -- testified in the NT
- Upper room -- large, 120 there in [[Acts 1#15]]
- Private hoses ([[Acts 2#46]], [[Acts 5#42]], [[Acts 20#20]])
- "house of Mary, mother of John Mark" ([[Acts 12#12]])
- House of Lydia in Philippi [[Acts 16#15]]
- Prisca and Aquila in Ephesus ([[Rom 16#5]], [[1 Cor 16#19]])

Norm in this period to about late 200s
- Expelled from the synagogue
- destruction of the Temple
- Illegal religion in Rom,e thus no public assemblies

Typical dimensions of homes in this time would not have allowed for a group
larger than 20 or 30 people
    - But 3000 added on Pentecost XXX

Larger rooms -- dining rooms
- reclined on couches
    - *triclinium*  -- three-stepped couch
    - highest, middle, lowest couch
- eventually with more people and the Eucharist separated from the meal, there
was one table with a chair for the Bishop which faced East
    - Eastern liturgy always retained free standing altar, the bishop's throne
    behind it, and Eastward celebration

#### Apostolic centers
Each apostolic center became a source of a distinctive liturgical Tradition
- Jerusalem -- James
- Antioch -- Peter
- Alexandria -- Mark
- Rome -- Peter
- Ephesus -- John

#### Liturgical languages
**Hebrew**  was a liturgical language of the Temple and Synagogue and naturally
entered Christian worship

**Aramaic** was spoken language of Palestine; preserved in some Syrian rites and
the maronite Catholic rite

**Greeek** was the most common language in the Roman Empire;NT written in Greek,
it was also the earliest liturgical language

**Latin**  became the official langiage of the Roman Empire and religion
- only a minority of Roman Empire's populaiton was Roman; hence, Latin was not
initially widely used outside Itally until 4th century
- Not until end of 2nd century does Latin begin to be used and only in the
Liturgy of NBorth Africa (Not Rome; Roman Church was more conservative)

#### Primary sources: Didache
First non-scriptural document on the liturgy
- 50-110 AD of syrian origin, unknown until 1875; was on the shelf in an Eastern
monastery and published in 1883
> Orthodox

Jewish in form but Christian in substance
- Blessing (kiddush), petition
- Eucharist and then meal

Emphasiszes Sunday as the new day of worship (14.1)

Highlights confession of sin before the Eucharist
