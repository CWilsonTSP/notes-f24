### Apostolic Tradition -- Eucharist

First Real liturgical document
- Treats fasting, prayer, reservation of the Eucharist, sign of the Cross,
baptism, ordination, diverse miniseries, the catechumenate, offertory, and a
Eucharistic prayer

offertory
- Kiss of peace before the offertory (4.46 and 21.26)
- Many items at the offertory -- oil, cheese, olives; a similar prayer of thanks
is said over them after the Eucharistic prayer (6.1)

Concelebration
- "Let the deacons present the oblations to him \[the bishop\] and, laying hands on
it with the whole presbytery, let him say, giving thanks" (4.2)

First text of a Eucharistic prayer
- only a model, explicit about being a suggestion; texts were often improvised
    - preserved by the Abyssinian church in Ethiopia (basis of Eucharistic
    Prayer II)

it contains most parts of the Eucharistic prayer (4.1-13)
- Opening dialogue
- preface (and perhaps the *Sanctus*, as something seems to be missing from the
text)
- praise and thanksgiving
- anamnesis (before and after institution)
- institution (joined with anamnesis)
- oblation
- epiclesis (on the presbyterate and the faithful)
- supplication
- doxology and amen

An Agape meal is referred to in some detail as a distribution of blessed bread
and cup in the evening, but is distinguished from the Eucharist (25.1-26-30)
- mentions a blessing of an evening lamp, like Sabbath blessings (25.1-2)
- "\[Bishop\] does not say 'lift up your heats' because it is only said at
    the offering" (25.26)
- "this is 'euology', but not 'eucharist' like the Body of the Lord." (26.2)

#### Didascalia Apostolorum
Full Title -- "Catholic Teaching of the Twelve Apostles and Holy Disciples of
Our Savior"
- Author knew the Didache, [[topics/ignatius-of-anioch|Ignatius of Antioch]], and Irenaeus
- is a "church order", ie. manual, or custom-book
    - from early 3rd century by a bishop in northern Syria
- no particular structure but has a wide range of topics
    - offers a window into the life of the 3rd century church

liturgical directives -- good order in the assembly of the faithful
- Priests: reserve a place in the eastern part of the house, and set the bishop's
those in the midst of them, The priests are it sit with him. Then lay men and
the women. You should pray facing East. 12.2
- Deacons stay "near the offerings" and assist people to find a place
 (ushers?)-- make sure no one falls asleep or laughs or makes signs: "it is
 fitting that in the church, everyone should maintain an attitude of full
 dignity" 12.3
- "If a poor person comes in, whether the are form your own parish or another,
e XXX"

Not attending the Eucharist -- "to fail to attend the assembly was to deprive
Christ of one of his members and to rend the Body of the Lord" 13.1

Deaconesses -- "A woman for the service of the women" (16.3) -- "there are
houses to which, because of the pagans, you cannot send a deacon to look after
the women, but you can very well send a deaconess. When women descend into the
water, it is required that those who thus descend be anointed by the
deaconesses. It is not fitting that the women be seen by men. If there is no
woman present, give an anointing only on the head. When the baptized woman comes
up our of the water, the deaconess is to receive her. This is the reason for
our saying that the service of a deaconess is required and necessary" 16.1
> appointed, not ordained by the laying on of hands

Cemeteries -- "come together even in the cemeteries, and read the holy
Scripture, and offer and acceptable eucharist, both in your congregations and in
your cemeteries and on the departures of them that sleep" (funerals?) 26.17

### Growth and consolidation
#### important dates
313 - Edict of Milan
330 - Imperial capital moved to Constantinople 
364 - Roman Empire divided into East and West
380 - Christianity becomes the state religion
410 - Rome sacked by the Visigoths
476 - Fall of Rome

#### Historical and Social Context
Edict of Milan -- 313 AM, Emperor Constantine made Christianity legal, leading
to the freedom of the Church
- 20% of people at this time were Christian (substantial minority)
- Christianity became part of the public fabric, new Christians in large numbers
- for first time, churches built -- basilicas, not temples

380 AM, Theodosius makes Christianity the state religion
- Massive conversions (~50%) which left to the need for the Church to adapt and
her liturgy to adapt to new conditions
- Church no longer small group opposed by Society at large, instead of
adversaries, now Church and Society allies
- bishops become temporal officials; court ceremonies applied to the Church and
her liturgy
- Church becomes the transmitter of culture, education; theology begins to glower,
but so does heresy

Church no longer just the committed faithful, but includes many varying degrees
of commitment
- new reasons for entering the Church: faith, social status, advancement,
government positions
- decrease in frequency of communion, unlike the days of the martyrs
- Spurred on the monastic movement as a reaction to "social" Christianity

#### consolidation
Freedom of the Church produced greater possibility of communication,
interaction, and organized consolidation

330 AD, Imperial capital moved to Emperor Constantine from Rome to Byzantium,
which he renamed Constantinople 
- profound consequences: a new patriarchate, not because of apostolic
foundation, but political prominence

*Sedes Apostolicae* (apostolic sees) to patriarchates
- Apostolic Sees -- centers due to actual/historical apostolic establishment
(theological)
- Patriarchates -- centers due to administrative, political, or geographical
reasons

Four Patriarchates established by Nicaea (325):
- Rome (acknowledges by all as principle)
- Jerusalem (important but not primary)
- Alexandria
- Antioch

#### Patriarchates
Constantinople -- Added by Council of Constantinople (381); ranked second to
Rome by Caldedon (451)
- Patriarchates of Jerusalem, Alexandria, Antioch broke away; eventually some
reconciled with Constantinople, some with Rome and some developed their own
Traditions (Coptic church, Armenian Church, etc.)

Every Church felt obligated, especially in 4th century, to seek a connection
with apostolic foundations or with New Testament foundation (Eg. Mark in Alexandria)

Bishops of other centers exercised jurisdiction of local churches in their
regions
- local churches of the same province tended to take their families from the
Traditions of the metropolitan church, leading to diverse liturgical families

#### Western liturgical families
Rome -- was the only liturgical center in the west:
- North African (Carthage)
- Ambrosian (Milan)
- Mozarabic (Spain)
- Gallican (France and Germany)
- Celtic (England, Scotland, Ireland)

These each had their own liturgical traditions, which took their inspiration
from the Roman liturgy
- Roman liturgy tended to be austere, restrained, concise, and linear
> Less flourishy 

Jerusalem -- although center of the apostolic church, had been destroyed in 70
AD; rebuilt after the Edict of Milan
- St. Cyril of Jerusalem in late 4th century, restored Jerusalem as a great
liturgical center
- influential to other liturgical families because it was a center also for
pilgrimage

Antioch
- West Syrian (Melkites) -- great cultural center; much more Hellenized than
East Syrians; Greek speaking; Loyal to Roman Emperor and Roman Church; rites are
the root of the Byzantine liturgy
- East Syrian (Chaldean) -- heirs of the Semitic/Aramaic tradition; language
originally Aramaic (Maronites); missionized the Malabar Coast of India
(Syro-Malabar rite); remained on the "outside" and suspicious of the Empire and
non-Semitic "greeks"

Alexandria -- Greatest city of Egypt; as the empire disintegrated it stood on its own
- Ancestor or the Coptic and Ethiopian rites with greater emphasis on the
    divinity of Christ in reaction to Arianism

> Arianism -- denies the full divinity of Christ the Son

Constantinople -- developed later, but adopted and adapted the Antiochene rite,
enriched with court ceremonials
- Mother rite for many Eastern rites (Greek, Russian, Ukranian, Rumanian)
Byzantine liturgy most important of all Eastern liturgies
- liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (d. 407) and liturgy of St. Basil (d. 379) --
likely not written by the, but traceable to their influence

Eastern liturgies tended to have poetic exuberance, splendor, elaboration, and
were more complex.

> anaphora: The "core of the liturgy of the Eucharist", from the moment of the
> dialogue through the Eucharistic prayer and doxology. Means "to look up" or
> "recall". 
> anamnesis: "dimension of remembrance". A specific part of an anaphora; recalls
> the passion, resurrection, ascension, and perhaps the life of Christ

> Do this in remembrance of me: is not principally of the Last Supper, but of
the Sacrifice on the Cross.
