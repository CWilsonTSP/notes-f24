# 11 -- 300s and 400s
## 2024-09-30

> Beginning focus on the Roman Rite (starting in Rome)

#### Roman Mass of the 4th and 5th Centuries
Sources of the Mass in the 300s and 400s
- Apostolic Constitutions (late 4th century)  -- another church "order"
    - Compilation of earlier material (Didache, Apostolic Tradition, Didascalia)
    with the addition of original compositions
    - originating in Antioch, valuable liturgical resource for this period
- St. Ambrose -- *On the Mysteries* 
- St. Cyril of Jerusalem -- *Mystagogical Catecheses* 

*Corpus Mysticum* -- term for the sacramental body, the corporeal presence of
Christ in the Eucharist given to us that we may become the *corpus verum* (Sp.
of Lit. 86-7)
- Holy or Sacred Mysteries

#### Titular Churches
Stational or Titular churches
- Roman liturgy essentially all papal; all liturgy rooted in the bishop
- earliest practice: one Eucharist per Sunday per city, celebrated by the bishop
and all clergy with all people of the local church; pattern quickly became
unworkable.
- In Rome, "stational" or "titular" churches developed: not really parish church
as such, although they could be considered the roots of parish churches; here
the Pope and clergy would travel from one church to another to celebrate at
different times
- Sign of unity and communion

Also "shrine" churches, built on the graves of martyrs 
- The faithful would gather the remains of martyrs and lovingly preserve them
- **Origin of Altar Stones**  -- after the 5th century, when conditions
deteriorated in Rome so that it was no longer same to venture out to these
shrines, relics were brought to the stational churches and places in the altars
for safekeeping

### Structure of the Mass
#### Introductory Rites
Originally began with Scripture
- But introductory rites were introduced to assemble people and prepare them
- Arrival of the pope at the church became an occasion for solemn procession,
accompanied by singing of psalms

Greeting of pope and people
- Pope -- "Peace to all"
- People -- "And with your spirit" (not the priest as an individual but as
Christ, whose Spirit the priest has received)

Pope prayed an oration facing east; people responded 
- earliest collections of liturgical materials were in scrolls and included only
changeable prayers

Pope sat in elevated chair in apse; priests around him.

#### Liturgy of the Word
Reader went to the ambo, elevated in choir section of the nave
- Council of Hippo (393 AD) decreed that only canonical Scriptures could be read
at mass
- Theological -- use in liturgy was a key factor for discerning the canon of
Scripture 

**Readings**:
1. Old Testament
2. From the step (*gradus*) of the ambo a singer led the singing of a psalm
   (gradual)
3. Reading from the Epistles

**Gospel** -- Singing of the alleluia was introduction to the proclamation  of
the Gospel by the deacon; incense without chain used to honor Gospel
- homily followed

**Dismissal** -- all catechumens dismissed, along with penitents
- By 305, attendance was an obligation of church law; missing it meant a person
had to forgo Holy Communion and do penance before being restored (order of
penitents)

#### Prayer of the Faithful
Only the faithful participated because only they shared i Christ's priesthood by
virtue of baptism
- In the East, these were in litany form, with the response, "*Kyrie eleison* "
- In the West, took the form of solemn prayers:
    - invitation to prayer
    - kneeling in silence
    - concluding oration by the celebrant, then an Amen by the people
    - still the form of the Good Friday solemn intercessions
- "Our Father" served as a concluding prayer to these intercessions

Kiss of peace followed as a preparation to the Liturgy of the Eucharist
- Imitating [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/47 - Matthew/Mt-05#23|Mt 5:23-24]] as a sign of peace and reconciliation prior
to the offertory

#### Offertory
**Procession** -- Originally, deacons would bring bread and wine to the altar,
but in Rome a procession of the gifts developed
- Singing of a psalm accompanied the procession
- People would bring their own bread and wine to contribute along with other
gifts (oil, honey, money, candles, etc.)
- Deacons collected and arranged; by 397 Council of Carthage, in celebration of
Mass, nothing is to be placed on the altar but what the Lord himself used:
bread, wine, and water
    - origin of side altars -- additional gifts placed on side tables around the
    church

**Collection** -- people offered their contributions as a sign and prayer that
they shared in the fruits of the Mass
- Those who had given gifts were named before the oration
- St. Jerome criticized this -- names were silent in Rome by 416

**Washing of hands** -- bishop and priests
**Oration** -- prayer by the celebrant concluded it (prayer over the gifts)

#### Anaphora
Developments of the Roman Canon
- Basically though not totally in placed by the end of the 4th century
- **Prefaces** -- still being compose (most written in mid 5th to early 7th
century)
- **Sanctus** -- by 400, the Sanctus is found in nearly all Eastern liturgies
and some Western
    - By 500 it is universal, with the "*Benedictus*" added
- **Names of the saints** -- added and organized
- **Intercessions** -- not a part of the canon, came when prayers of the
faithful had declined in used (early 500s?)
- **Doxology elevation** -- at the end of the prayer, during the Doxology, the
people held up the paten, the deacon held the chalice

Western understanding of Word-Institution
- Ambrose *Mysteries* 52 and 54

#### Breaking of Bread -- Fraction
In Rome, after the Amen
- By the time of St. Augustine, some favored placing the Our Father at the end
of the Anaphora in the presence of Christ (Cyril also has it here)
- At other times in the West it was said after the fraction

Fraction and commixture:
- breaking of the consecrated leavened bread was a profound spiritual reality
and a practical necessity for admisinstration
- *Fermentum* -- part of the pope's host sent from Papal Masses in Rome to be
placed into chalices of stational masses, to show unity with the Pope
- *Sancta* -- host from previous mass to show continuity of the same sacrifice

"Showing" of the Eucharist
- Cyril has "Holy things for the Holy" with the response, "one is Holy, One is
Lord" -- still present in the Byzantine rite
    - Later, the West has *Ecce Agnus Dei* and the response *Domine, non sum
    dignus...* 

#### Communion
People came forward and the priest present the communicant with "The Body of
Christ"
- People received cups of wines which included a few drops of the precious
blood, administered by the deacons
- Psalms were sung during the distribution

Conclusion -- after Communion, a prayer is said bu the priest, and the deacon
dismissed the congregation saying "*Ite, missa est* "
- origin of the final blessing -- as the people would leave the church, he would
bless the people
- sometimes a prayer over the people would be said between the prayer and the
dismissal (Lent, Good Friday, etc.)
