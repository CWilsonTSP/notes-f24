### Overview of Eastern Liturgies

### Antiochian: West Syria 
#### Anaphora of St. James
Attributed to James the Lesser, brother (cousin) of the Lord, 1st bishop of
Jerusalem

This anaphora is the basic forumulary for the West-Syrian liturgical family and
the basis for many of its anaphoras

**took** -- Promiyon-Sedra, blessing of the Censor, Kiss of peace (latter, the
Creed), Unveiling and Placing of the Hands prayer
**blessed** -- Dialogue, Preface, Sanctus, words of institution, Anamnesis,
Epiclesis, Petitions
**broke** -- Fracturing, liturgy of Repentance and Lord's prayer, Doxology
**gave** -- Invitation to Holy Communion, Procession of the Holy Mysteries,
Prayer of Thanksgiving, Dismissal

#### Syrian Rite
Had over 60 anaphoras; 18 still in use; all based on the Anaphora of St. James

Liturgical languages are Syriac, Arabic, and vernacular

Characterized by many gestures, poetic texts, and rites of incensation

Some Syrian Christians rejected Chalcedon in 451; headed by Bishop Jacob
Baradai, they became known as Jacobites, were Monophysites

Orthodox Christians remained Catholic until 1054

1783, a Syrian Catholic Patriarchate was re-established

Most Syrian Catholics today are in Iraq

#### Malankarese Rite (india)
Mostly vernacular, with some Syriac

1653, group of Catholics on the Malabar coast of South India joined the
Syro-Jacobite Patriarchate, adopting their rite

1930, many returned to Catholic communion, and were allowed to retain their
Syrian rite

#### Maronite Rite (Lebanon)
5th century Syrians loyal to Catholic faith, followers of a monk, Blessed
Anchorite Maron

In 8th century when patriarch of Antioch moved to Constantinople, the Maronites
consecrated a patriarch of Antioch, forming a Maronite patriarchate

Under the persecution from Moslems and Jacobites, they took refuge in the wooded
mountains of Lebanon

Though practically autonomous, union with Rome always maintained, with the
patriarch recognized by Rome
    - From about 16th century there was an increased Latinization approved in
1736 at the council of Mount Lebanon

Liturgical languages are Syriac, Arabic, Aramaic, and vernacular (12 anaphoras)

> Latinization -- could be an authoritative imposition (Like Charlamagne) but
> more often things slipping from the Latin liturgy into the others

>  Maroinite looks almost exactly like the Latin rite

### East Syrian

#### Anaphora of Addai and Mari

East Syria traces their heritage to St. Thomas the Apostle, strongest heirs of
Semitic and Aramaic liturgical tradition taken from Jerusalem via Edessa

Addai was the traditional founder of the Church at Edessa (Syria); traditionally
known as one of the 72 diciples of Christ and subsequently, a disciple of St.
Thomas; Mari was a disciple of Addai

This anaphora is essential for understanding the early history of the liturgy
- Contains no words of institution (Tradition of the Didache?)
- Composed about 200 AD
- Still in used by Nestorian Christians, Chaldean and Syro-Malabar Catholics

Anaohora XXX finish

Liturgical and Sacramental importance:
- Words of institution are not a magical formula or incantation
- Though words are normative in the West, the whole context of prayer is the
essential element (the whole liturgical action)
- Past papal declarations that the words are essential are recognized in the
mention of the body and blood of Christ dispersed through the rite, even though
the explicit institution narrative is not present
- sheds light on the theology of Consecration and the Epiclesis in the Eastern
tradition

#### Chaldean Rite (Iraq, Iran)
Christians in Iraq (Babylonia, East Syria) since 2nd century; also called
"Assyrians" or "Persians" originally under patriarchate of Antioch

Retained their Semitic roots more than any other liturgy

Became infected with Nestorian heresy in 484 but in 1340 as a result of
Nestorian collapse to Islam, Chaldean Christians turned to Rome

Liturgical language is Chaldean (dialect of Aramaic)

Liturgy of singing and breaking

#### Malabarese or Syro-Malabar Rite (India)
Missionary was St. Thomas

At one time under Persian bishops, but remained from from Nestorianism

Portuguese colonization fruthered Catholic communion, but they tried to Latinize
the rite, which caused trouble, and a portion joined the Jacobites

1923 Malabarese hierarchy re-established

Liturgical language is Chaldean and Malayalma

Holy Qurbana (offering, Sacrifice)
- readings (ad populum) and eucharist (ad orientem)

### Alexandrian 
#### Anaphora of Serapion
Alexandria traces their liturgical heritage to St, Mark

The Euchologoion of Bishop Serapion of Thmuuis (d. 369) Alexandria, Egypt; a
well known friend of St. Athanasius; sacramentary found in 1894, only text, no
rubrics, and no longer in use. Unique features of this anaphora are:
- Mass prayers begins with a prayer for a faithful reading of the Scriptures
- After the homily, there are good general prayers for the church followed by a
blessing by the bishop for a good crop, church, etc.
- There is much Greek oratory, embellishment, and a theologizing tend in
language; earliest record of the Sanctus
- Reoccurring doxology -- directed to God through Christ in the Holy Ghost
    - Fundamental Orientation of Christian prayer
- Institution narrative -- witnesses many historical sources and has unique
embolisms amid the narrative

> Embolism == expansion
> Deliver us, O Lord, from every evil

#### Coptic Rite (Egyptian)
Under the patriarchate of Alexandria

Many anaphoras, one called St. Gregory of Nazianzus which is addressed not to
the Father, but instead to the Son

457, they accepted Monophysitism and broke from Catholic unity

1740, a Coptic Bishop in Jerusalem entered communion with Holy See

Language is Coptic and Arabic, and Vernacular

XXX something else?

### Constantinopoiitan
#### Byzantine
Eucharist rite derived from from West Syrian tradition (Antioch)

After schism of 1054, Constantinople sought to replace other rites with its own,
and prohibited the Alexandrian rite of St. Mark and the Jerusalem rite of St.
James

Characterized by clergy in splendid vestments, lights, and incense; additional
bowings, solemn processions during the bearing of the gifts and distribution of
Holy Communion with ceremonies derived from the imperial court.

The basic liturgies are those of St. Basil (4th century) and St. John Chrysostom
(5th Century)
- both follow the same structure, but some different prayers

#### anaphoras of Sts. Basil and John Chrysostom
Basil -- enlarged and selectively chosen texts for the anaphora; advanced the
trend of growing conciousness of sin and a more profound reverence of the great
mystery

John Chrysostom -- Short and more succinct; he called the mysteries "the terrible
sacrifice," "shuttering hour," and "terrible and awful table"

Through these attitudes, the Eastern liturgy took on a greater splendor and the
atmosphere was marked by a holy awe

Iconostasis -- evolved from railings and the incorporation of icons
- hastened and favored development because of the iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th
centuries to which the Iconostasis was a response 
- signified the descent of heaven to earth and anticipated the Parousia

> Trisagion -- Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One

#### Greek
Constantinople not of apostolic doundation, but recognized by the COuncil of
Calcedon in 541

POwer of Constantinople gew as seat of empire, also as power of other Oriental
patriarchates collapsed by defections to Monophysitism and Islam

1054 Scism of Eastern Church and Constantinople

1829 some Greeks sought reunionn with Catholic Church

language remains Ancient Greek

#### Russian
9th century, greek monks Cyril and XXX

#### Ruthenian and Ukranian

Ruthenian Rite (very similar to Russian, different geographic region)

Ukranian
- Like Russian Church, was Eastern, and after 1054 schism a Catholic
Metropolitan XXX

> St. Johosephat

# ### Melchite

#### Armenian
