### Outline
- Reasons for Trent's reform
- Reform in view of Protestantism
- New missal of Pope St. Pius V
- Order of the 1570 missal

### Historical Context

### Reasons for Trent's reform
The thrust of thew whole council was to address the proliferation of
Protestantism, its doctrinal errors, and abuses in the Church; sought true
reformation

Trent saw the need for reform of liturgy in view of:
##### Synods
many synods and provincial councils in the first half of the
16th century became aware of the harm of certain superfluous rituals and
superstitious practices and called for the revision of liturgical books; was
regularly delayed

##### Restoration
Purging of excessing elaboration, complication, customs, superstitious practices
(e.g. avarice in number of stipends, wondering around from elevation to
elevation, superstition around fixed numbers of Masses or candles or "fruits" of
the Mass)
- fruits -- things not necessarily 

> [!quote] Council of Trent, Session x, Ch. x
> Local ordinaries shall be zealously concerned and be bound to prohibit and
> abolish all those things which either covetousness ....

##### Protestantism
Doctrinal clarity was the priority, in view of protestant liturgical practices
(e.g. Real Presence, Sacrifice, Priesthood)

##### Catholic Unity
For Trent, this meant uniformity XXX


### Reform in view of Protestantism
The Protestant Rebellion greatly affected the council's position toward liturgy
and its emphasis on certain components
- This set the tone and direciton for St, Pius V who was tasked with developing
a new Missal, for his small comission, and for the newly established (1588)
Congregation of Rites which, enforced the reform
- XXX

Protestants used the vernacular -- Catholics would continue using Latin
- Council Fathers discussed the possibility of using the vernacular and many were
anxious that the vernacular not be condemned (reasonable so, since Greek and
Latin were once the vernacular)


> [!quote] Council of Tent, Session 22, Ch. 8
> Not been deemed advisable ... but the holy council commands pastors...
> explain frequency during the celebration of the mass some off the things read
> during the mass, and that among other things they explain some mystery of this
> most holy sacrifice, especially on Sundays and festival days

Protestants insisted on the restoration of the chalice to the laity -- the Mass
would retain Holy Communion under one species
- discussed the validity of both

    > [!quote] Council of Tent, Session 21, Ch. 2
    > Although from the beginning of Christian worship the use of both kinds was
    > common, yet that custom was very widely changed in the course of time; and
    > so holy mother church, acknowledging her authority over the administration
    > of the sacraments ... 
    > by weighty and just reasons, has approved of this custom of communicating
    > under one species xxx

Protestants rejected the priesthood -- the Mass would give prominence to the
role of the priest
- Trent also wanted people to be isntructed about the Mass, readings, and the
mysteries celebrated; urged more frequent communion; and several insisted that
those who say the Canon aloud be left undisturbed 
- highlighted the priest in almost every session

    > [!quote] 13.8

Protestants denied Transubstantiation -- the Mass would put a great emphasis on
the Real Presence 

> [!quote] 3.5

Protestants rejected sacrifice -- the Mass would stress the sacrificial element

The authoritative strength of Trent brought about a uniformity for several
hundred years
- Further developments still occurred, of course

### New missal of Pope St. Pius V

Published in 1570 (exactly 400 years before Pope St. Paul VI)

Printing made its distribution and use possible, in a way which had never been
possible before
- Diversity had been the rule -- not uniform celebration

The goal was not to invent a new liturgy, but to return to earlier purity
- The desire was tot return to the usage of the Gregorian missal; however, they
lacked historical documents, and time for the historical research it would be
similar to the Roman Curial Mass of 1474.

Several elements in the Missal of Pius V are of Franco-Germanic origin.

##### Simplifications and Changes
- Revised and simplified the liturgical calendar 
- reduced the number of commemorations of saints 
- reduced collects to 3 (was up to 7) 
- sequences reduced to four
- began to remove musical settings that were extraneous to the liturgy
- standardized the offertory

##### standardized the principle of "Cumulation"
- Repetition of prayers
- duplication of themes (parallels)
- Every action accompanied by a prayer
- "apologies"

### Order of the 1570 missal
#### Overview of the Mass of St. Paul V
Adopted "low mass" as the basic form and saw "high mass" as an elaboration of it
- Reverse of the actual progress of historical development, in which the Solemn
Mass was the norm and the "low mass" was a derivation from it

Low Mass:
- Priest
- Server

High Mass:
- ministers
- server
- deacon
- sub-deacon
- choir
- priest (still did all the parts)

##### Ordinary and Propers
1. The "Ordinary" includes the texts of the Mass which remain the same in each
   celebration
2. The "Propers" are those texts which change, depending on the Liturgical Day

The essential structure of this Mass corresponds with how Mass is celebrated
today
