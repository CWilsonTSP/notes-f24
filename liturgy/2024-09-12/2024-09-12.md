## Early Patristic Period

#### Historical Context
~130-~300

The Apostles were no longer alive and were of necessity replaced in the
leadership of Christian Communities.
- NT with Paul and Timothy
- clement -- Jesus' desire to find others and appoint them
    - received from Christ's own mouth, presents a living traditions

Apostolic sees and local communities had relative autonomy in liturgical
celebrations.
- basis structure but adaptive forms, oral tradition still central
    - so things decided on by bishops and individual presbyters 
- no fixed formulary; documents are offered for supposed in the liturgy
- centralization occurred only after end of persecution
    - post Constantine 

#### Clement of Rome
Pope from 92 to 101 AD
- 3rd successor
- Close of apostolic period (apostolic father)
- Turtullian says was ordained by St. Peter

Letter to Corinthians (ca. 96) deals with strife in local church
- oldest non-canonical literature by an identified author
- No liturgical writings as such, but implications about liturgy
- insists that God has instituted order and that legitimate superiors must be
obeyed; evidence of Roman primacy already

Eucharistic implications
- evidence of three-fold ministry: bishop, presbyters, deacons
    - speaks of "offering the gifts" at the Eucharist as a function of bishop
    and presbyters
- refers to Eucharist as a "spiritual" or "reasonable" sacrifice, unlike pagans,
and likens the Eucharistic sacrifice to that of the Temple
- "services" at "set times" (40.1-2)
- assigned symbolic value to times of the day, relating it to the Resurrection

#### Ignatius of Antioch
Bishop who succeeded St. Peter in Antioch
- Disciple of St. John
- martyred in Rome, d. 110

Wrote seven letters on his journey
- pleas for unity of faith and of sacrifice -- crucial for understanding the
beginning of the second century
- Bishop is the center of ecclesial life; chief points of reference are baptism
and Eucharist

Letter to the Ephesians
- "show obedience with undivided mind to the bishop and the presbyters, and to
break the same bread, which is the medicine of immortality, and antidote against
death and everlasting life in Jesus Christ" (1.20)
- "assemble more frequently" "to celebrate God's Eucharist and to offer praise"
"powers of Satan overcome" (13.1)
- No authentic Eucharist without bishop, must be celebrated in harmony with the
Church (5.1)

Letter to the Philadelphians
- 'be careful to participate in only one Eucharist, for there is only one flesh
of our Lord Jesus Christ and one cup to united us in his blood, one altar just
as there is one bishop, with the presbyters and deacons' (4.1)

Letter to the Smyrnaeans
- He criticizes those who "abstain from the Eucharist", because "they do not
confess that the Eucharist is the flesh of Our Lord Jesus Christ", the flesh
that suffered for our sins and that the Father in his goodness raised up again
(7)

> Some Christian communities did not celebrate the Eucharist on days which
martyrdom occurred, because they thought "the Eucharist had already been
celebrated"

#### Pliny the Younger
Pagan
- Legate of Bathynia
- Letter to Emperor Trajan
- 112 AD

He arrested and examined several Christian and established certain facts:
- on "stated day" --Sunday, a regular workday
- "accustomed to meet before daybreak and to recite a hymn among themselves to
Christ, as though he were a god" -- Lauds?
- They bound themselves to do no wrong; he recognized them for high morality
- "depart and meet again at a later hour to take good" -- Eucharist? agape meal>
-- calls it "harmless"

#### Justin Martyr
apologist and Martyr
- 150 AD, Rome
- philosopher, who found the truth in Christ

*First Apology* -- though not a liturgical text, describes in detail the
actions that occurred in the early liturgy
- Sunday is the day of Eucharist
- liturgy of the Word -- "memoirs of the apostles"
- Kiss of peace
- mixed chalice
    - Normal Jewish and Roman uses as wine was too strong and expensive
- Christ's institution
- Eucharistic prayer -- Thanksgiving according to ability of the one offering
- Congregation's Amen (Hebrew)
- Flesh and blood of Jesus not "ordinary food"
    - only believers can partake
        - same from in Didache
- Collection
- Deacons take the Eucharistic to the sick

> He gives this information to demonstrate to Roman authorities that Christians
> are not some arbitrary mystery cult, so he makes known everything that they do

Justin's languages is very Roman in style; crisp, ordered, rich in meaning,
excessive precision and no excess of sentimentality (Greco-Roman influence)
- We see the basic patter of *Roman* prayers:
    - God who (*attribute or activity*), ... grant that (*petition offered*) ...
    through Christ our Lord who lives and reigns for ever and ever.
- His account is valuable not only for Rome but perhaps for much of the
Christian world through which he traveled form east to weest (Jung, 22)
- Also, CCC 1345 -- the Mass of all ages

#### Clement of Alexandria

School of Alexandria
- "New philosophy"
    - In Christ, what was held by the Greeks has been realized by Christ
- d. ~215 AD

Points
- Egypt: set times for prayer at third, sixth, and ninth hours, as well as on
rising, before retiring, and during the night
- grace before and after meals
- eastward orientation of prayer -- Christ as the rising Sun, light of the word
-- "prayers are made towards the sunrise in the East"
- Eschatological character of Night Prayer (Vigils) -- expectant waiting
- On Eucharist
    - kiss of peace
    - prayer on 'tiptoe'
        - "we stand on tiptoe at the final acclamation of our prayer" -- raising
        prayers up to heaven
    - water and wine
        - "there is an analogy between the mingling of the wine and the water
        and the mingling of man and the Spirit"

#### Tertullian
Layman
- Lawyer
- church of Carthage
- intensely cutting and influential ecclesiastical writer
- rigorist
- joined the heretical Montanists
- 3. 220 AD

Gives evidence of growing standardization of Christian prayer
- orientation, when to stand or kneel
- place of the psalmody as important part of prayer

**Catholic practices** -- "The sacrament of the Eucharist, prescribed for all bu
the Lord at the time of the supper, we also reeieve during the *pre-dawn*
meetings, and from the very hands of those who preside of the assembly. We make
the offerings for the *dead* on the anniversary day of thir 'birth'. On the *Day
of the Lord,* we hold *fasting* or *praying* on our ... " XXX finish

Prayer, petitions, readings, homily (Apologeticum 39.2-6)

Collection

Tradtional order of Readings
- "The Scriptures are read, psalms are sung, sermons are given, prayers are
offered" (De anima, 9.4)

Offertory
- Lord's prayer said at conclusion of the prayer of the faithful, just before
kiss of peace, which preceded the offertory

Communion
- Faithful respond "amen" when receiving the Sacred Species. At times, the
faithful took Eucharist home with them to communicate themselves during the week;
daily reception seems to have been common

#### Catacombs
Not hiding places -- Romans knew about them; they were cemeteries of Rome, not
secret hideaways
- only found in Rome

Custom of "refrigerium" -- banquet celebrated for the memory or well-being of a
deceased person

Burial and memorial liturgies; on graves of martyrs
- origin of "tomb" altar against the wall (that is how Roman graves were built)
-- never happened in the East, because no catacombs
    - origin of altar against the wall, but East always had freestanding

#### St. Hippolytus of Rome
Rigorist; set himself up as anti-pope to Callixtus. Eventually reconcilled when
a prisoner riwht Pope Pontian in the mines of Sardinia, and died (235) as a
martyr; they are still commemorated in the universal calendar

Apostolic tradition -- ca. 215-225 and rediscovered in 1910
- Didache, Apostolic Tradition are "church orders"
- Important collection of laws and ordinances regarding the clergy, rites, and
ceremonies
- may not actually be the author, but church orders bear the names of those who
compiled them or authorities who imposed them
- Possibly Syrian or Alexandrian rather than Roman or influential because it was
Roman
