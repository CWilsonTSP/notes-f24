From the context of changing religious practices, especially in regarding what
is purportedly a natural development of the same religion, I find it frustrating
that the Eucharistic Prayer developed to be a single blessing rather than
multiple. If each of the individual blessings had a significant meaning for
reminding the Jewish people of salvation history, it would seem like the
sacrifice of Christ would have a similar blessing added to the set. I understand
that Christ died once for all and this sacrifice was the culmination of previous
ones and the starting of a new covenant, but the other historical religious
events that they commemorated were also signified by covenants. It just seems
like a break in their tradition, perhaps being just another one of the many
things that eventually distinguished Christianity from Judaism.
