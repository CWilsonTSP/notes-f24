### Overview

#### Historical Context of the 700s-1100s
Further decline, social and governmental fragmentation
- Barbarians, vikings, rise of Islam, loss of centralized Western government
- general loss of classical education: reading, literacy, language, catechetical
formation (schools of Alexandria and Antioch), books, copyists, were at a dismal
low in society at large
- Many unholy popes and the collapse of Papal moral authority

Attempts at political and cultural revival
- Short Carolingian Renaissance
- New Franco-Germanic Political center
- Feudalism
- Monastic growth and example (eg. Benedictine Cluniac reform)

Major liturgical development and reform of this period
- Romanizations of Gallican liturgies
- Transferal of the Romanized Gallican liturgy to the Roman liturgy

#### Declining education and the Clergy
Very few people were educated; even the clergy were barely literate (?)
- Emperor Charlemagne could not write; St. Alcuin taught him to read

Scriptoria declined
- Thus, liturgical books often fell into disrepair and were not replaced;
difficult to copy new ones

Clergy were frequently the only people who could read and write at all; so they
were admired and looked up to increasingly viewed as an "upper class" distinct
from the people
- Consequently, the role of the priest in the liturgy increased

#### Language
With the breakup of the Western Empire into chieftains, then into feudal lords,
there was no longer widespread commerce, travel, and education
- Local unwritten dialects began to develop into local languages around the 9th
century, but written verncalular didn't develop until the 10th to 12th century
    - eg. Romance (Italian, French, Spanish) and Germanic languages

Over time, Latin was no longer the common or universal language
- Few except the clergy could understand it, which gave them a certain prestige
- No vernacular liturgy-- why?
    - Initially, no written literature or texts in vernacular
    - Roman culture and language were still admired and considered the highest
    and best and the vernacular inferior (indeed, it was)

Parallel to this, vernacular elements were then introduced to the liturgy
- Tropes
- Sequences
- Expanded "alleluia" verse before the Gospel
- These were sung by the people while the Latin texts were sung by the clergy
    - Two parallel activities,as it were, one for the priest and one for the
    people
- Prone 
    - Some places began vernacular prayers of the faithful following the Gospel
    - Would develop later in the middle ages and include Scripture, sermon,
    prayers, announcements

#### New Franco-Germanic Center
Social disorder and fragmentation resulted in rise of a new political power in
Gallic, Franco-Germanic regions instead of Rome
- Historical overview of Clovis, Pepin, and Charlemagne

**Aachen**  -- New cultural center of emerging government, education, and art in
Franco-Germanic territory; became the capital of the "Holy Roman Empire"
- Still a deep admiration for the Roman Past, but adapted to a new mentality
- Culture more emotional and symbolic, not as logical, concise, and restrained 

**Cluniac Reform** (f. 909) -- Benedictine/Cistercian reform; eventually 1400
monasteries all under Cluny's abbots which including six consecutive saints who
each "reported" to the pope
- Cultivated the Roman liturgy with conscientiousness; enormous source of
ecclesial and liturgical renewal; produced many great popes (eg. Gregory VII)

#### History of the Evolution of the Roman Mass into the Franco-Roman Mass
There was a number of western liturgies, the most important one in France and
Germnay was the Gallican rite
- XXX come back to this

Factors that led to the beginning of the Romanization of Gallican rites
- The early Gallican sacramentaries were not duplicated and most were in poor
condition (few copyists) so Roman books had been imported into Gaul (7th century)
- Ignorant clergy, plague, and war had made preservation of Gallican rites
difficult, so the clergy used whatever texts they had available
- No one in Rome cared to produce standard liturgical books and the books they
had were primarily for pontifical Masses
    - Since parochial masses differed considerably, priests made do when they
    were unable to fulfill certain directives in their entirety

#### Dual Movement: Frankish and Roman
1. Increasing influence of Roman liturgy in the Frankish lands
    - Appeal to the authority of the papacy to bring social/political unity 
    - Roman liturgy came to dominate in the Former Gallican lands
2. Gallican additions, beloed over the course of centuries, were introduced into
   the Roman liturgy, and became well-established
    - Eventually these XXX

#### Collapse of Papal Moral Authority
From the 9th to 11th century, conditions in Rome were disastrous: not only had
the city declined, but the papacy as well
- In the past, the strong papacy had saved the social order (in the days of Leo,
Gelasius, and Gregory the great); now, the papacy was a central source of the
decline
- A series of weak, unworthy, ineffective, and evil popes furthered the change
of the center of gravity away from Rome
    - They fulfilled liturgical duties in a careless, slovenly XXX

### Liturgical Contributions of Franco-Germanic Rites
- Holy Week ceremonies
- Holy Silence
- Devotions at Mass
- Allegorical interpretation of the Mass
- Emphasis on reverence and awe
- Communion practices: unleavened bread, reception on the tongue, communion
under one species
- Prayer postures
- Creed
- Some parts of the liturgical cycle and readings

#### Holy Week 
No Pope until Paul VI ever visited the Holy Land, so Rome as not direclty
affected by the Jerusalem liturgies, Frankish clergy, however, were very open to
and fond of Eastern cusoms, and many were introduced
- Procession of Palms and "All Glory, Laud, and Honor" written by Bishop
Theodolph or Orleans around 800
- Tenebrae (office of Holy Week)
- Mandatum (foot washing) on Holy Thursday
- Veneration of the Holy Cross (still used in Good Friday liturgies)
- Easter Vigil rites: Paschal candle, blessing of water; singing of the Exaultet
-- all are Eastern influences which were included in the Frankish liturgies, and
which eventually found their way to Rome
