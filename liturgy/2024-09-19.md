### Initial East and West Contrast

General contrasting, theologically complementary, liturgical differences

| East   | West    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Gifts prepared at side table before the liturgy, and brought to altar in procession at the offertory   | Gifts prepared at offertory   |
| Many different anaphoras; but no propers as such   | One Eucharistic prayer (Roman Canon) but with several prefaces, inserts and changeable orations for different days   |
| Leavened bread   | Unleavened bread (7th century)   |
| Epiclesis is the consecration; follows words of institution   | Words of institution are consecration, follow Epiclesis   |

### Cultural Transformation and Liturgical Development
Two key principles of liturgical development in this period:
1. **Preserve** -- the apostolic tradition
2. **Adopt and Adapt**  -- elements of Greco-Roman culture

Primary areas of liturgical development following the cultural transformation of
the Empire:
- Architecture
- Music and Art
- language
- vesture
- religious and social customs
- calendar
- liturgy of the Hours

#### Architecture
**Basilicas**  -- Greek, *Basilikos* , imperial; Roman public assembly halls for
legal matters, government, and business
- rectangular with columned isles; a curved apse with a  seat foot the judge or
magistrate ideal for the Church -- simply add an altar!
- Some given to the Church (Lateran Palace); others built (St. Peter, St. Mary
Major)

As the Church grew, there was a movement from homes to basilicas that could
accommodate the entire community
- It was not the Jerusalem Temple, nor pagan temples, that were models for
Christian churches, because while they had a sanctuary, it was small in size
and only the priest could enter

theological Points:
- The church understood herself as "living stones" built together as an edifice
for God (cf. [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/67 - 1 Peter/1 Pt-02#5|1 Peter 2:5]]
- The entire notion of "Church" is assembly, gathering, convocation, all of
which is contained in the word *ecclesia* 

Because most basilicas faces the west, the presider faced the people and prayed
facing the direction in which the sun rises; this eastern orientation was both
an apostolic tradition and a broad cultural custom
- Jewish -- Toward Jerusalem (hence East in much of the Roman Empire)
- Pagans -- East to the sun as to a god
- Christian -- Bishops, priest, and deacons faces east fr the entire liturgy
(ordinary practice) which was also toward the people (normal circumstance of a
basilicas)
    - In an Egyptian liturgy, there is a point at which the people are directed
    to turn around to face the east; different practices in different regions

Glowering of church construction in the great Churches: Rome, Jerusalem,
Bethlehem, Constantinople
- Earliest church basilicas (St. Peter, St. John Lateran) followed Roman
 orientation
- 537 was inauguration of *Hagia Sophia* in Constantinople which was the first
church using a dome over cruciform base; pattern for all further eastern churches
- The basilica continued to be the pattern principally used in the west (though
round churches were not unknown)

#### Parts of an Early Christian Basilica
cf. model and pdf powerpoint for picture

#### Music
Rejection of the noisy, stirring, boisterous, agitating music of the pagan
temple (for demons and gods)
- spiritual values of music predominant; not to agitate but elevate, bring
peace and harmony (cf. Confessions 10.33.49)

No instruments permitted; only human voice (still the case in the East)

Two kinds of singing: responsorial and antiphonal
- Psalms were the primary text and music was the give *expression to the text* 

#### Art
Church in persecution had little leisure for elaborate art but the desire to
adorn the church or home is evident even from the earliest days (eg. primitive
paintings in the catacombs)

Follow the Edict, the Church adopted and adopted Roman styles
- Jesus depicted in the style of a Roman god: youthful, often unbearded, and in
Roman clothes
- none of the sensuality or licentious qualities of Roman art a chaste and
modest adaptation

No objection to depiction of Christ, saints, biblical themes

> St. John Damascene -- veneration of images, codified in the 2nd council of
> Nicea

#### language
in daily Roman life, Latin gradually replaces Greek
- at first, must resistance to abandoning the ancient and apostolic langiage of
Greek; but eventually vernacular (Latin) won out
- Soon, the liturgy of the Word was largly in Latin, but the Eucharistic prayer
in Greek. 375 AD, ther eis a document wirrten in Latin that quotes the Roman
Canon in Greek. By 380, Pope Damasus used Roman Canon in Latin

Two important notes:
1. Persistence of the *Kyrie* -- Church did not want to lose entirely ancient
   linguistic links
2. Latin was of an elevated and literary style. It was vernacular, but not
   common everyday language

Adoption of the vernacular was not universal:
- Syriac retained in India; Orthodox use ancient, not modern, Greek; Russions
use old church Slavonic, not modern Russian
- Yet, generally Byzantine East kept the principle of using the vernacular
- Often vestiges Preserved; eg. Amen, Kyria, Hosanna, Sabaoth

#### Vesture

The Initial liturgical vesture of this period were the ordinary garb of the
romans
- tunic (daily garb) and paenula (simple outer cloak)
- tunic replaced by alb, which was longer and more dignified

As bishops became temporal officials, the ceremonial garb of imperial court
transferred to the church
- Court dress (stoles signifying office; splendid paenula/toga to signify rank)

As fashions changed, vestments remained constant as a reminder of continuity
with the apostolic Church
- East garment took on symbolism
    - Cf. handout on vesting prayers

#### religious and social customs
**Litany**  -- form of prayer used in pagan (not Jewish) processions that was
adopted and radically adapted

**Kiss**  -- common social custom, original form was on the hand; showed
affection and reverence;
- kissing of altars common in temples; adopted universally by the Church for the
altar as a sign of reverence

**candle and incense**  -- part of Temple and Sabbath worship; also part of
imperial court, Christians saw nothing wrong with adapting these for the
liturgy.
- After Constantine, since the emperor no longer claimed divine prerogatives,
many forms of honor accorded to him transferred to the Bishop, especially the
Pope, as the representative of God's authority
- incense first linked to the OT Temple

#### Calendar
**Sunday** -- Early Christians did not place rigid limitations on Sunday
activities like the Jewish Sabbath (this came with the Puritans lmao)
- After the Edict of Milan, Christians were allowed not to work on Sunday; after
Christianity was the state religion, Sunday was protected by Law

**Date of Easter** -- earliest and, at first, the only annual commemoration
- Johannine: Crucifixion observed on the 14th of Nisan (day of preparation for
the Passover); Quartodecimans followed this date, no matter what the day of the
week.
- By 135 AD, in Jerusalem, Easter was always observed on the Sunday after the
Passover; held Sunday to be more important than adhering to the Jewish Calendar
- Controversy -- Rome celebrated on Sunday; Asian minor provinces on 14 Nisan; in
late 2nd century, Quartodecimans were excommunicated by Pope Victor; Irenaeus
argued for reconciliation
- council of Nicaea (325 AD) -- set Easter on the Sunday immediately after
Passover; Quartodecimans went into schism, but died out by the 5th century

**Lent** -- preparation of catechumens for Easter sacraments led to the
development of Lent

**Christmas**  -- the 2nd great Christian celebration was celebrated bu 336 AD
- probably not popular until the middle ages
- one theory is that Christians took the pagan feast of the emperor's birthday
(*Dies Natalis Solis Invicti*) -- Day of the Borth of the Unconquered Sun, and
made it the birthday of the Light of the Wordl at the darkest time of year,
Christ brings the light
    - "these old theories can no longer be sustained" (Ratzinger, Spirit of the
    Liturgy, 108)
- A tradition in Hippolytus, which is supported by the Gallican liturgy, is that
Jesus was conceived on the same day that he died
    - 14th of Nisan was March 25 -- Annunciation, nine months afterwards is
    December 25

**Advent** -- preparatory season, originally a festive celebration; not
recognizably penitential until 10th century

#### Liturgy as a Vehicle for Doctrine

As the Liturgy developed it also served as a central Vehicle for the unity of
doctrine
- Doxology -- "Glory to the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Spirit" became
"Glory to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit" -- Trinitarian reaction
against Arianism by 375 AD
- Marian devotions and feasts such as the Assumption (before 500) and her
Nativity on Sept. 8 (in the 500's) flowered in response to Nestorianism (two
persons of Christ) and following the Council of Ephesus in 431 which declared
Mary *Theotokos*
    - Feasts began in Nestorian strongholds, brought west by priests fleeing
    Islamic invasions
- Shift of meaning of wine and water from our union with Christ to doctrinal
statement about Christ's two natures in response to the Monophysites who said
Christ had only a divine nature into which his humanity was absorbed, and so
stopped mixing water with wine

Differing regions had different theological issues and thus different
formulations.
