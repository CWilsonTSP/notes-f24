# Liturgy Amid Protestant Reformation

## 2024-10-31

### Historical Context
#### Governemnt
No strong centralized government, especially in Germany; feudalism with varying
degrees of authority was the norm

Church, not state, was the source of unity and stability, this lasted well into
the middle ages; but in time stared to dissolve into kingdoms and then nations

By the 14th century, the Avignon Papacy, anti-popes, and the great Western
Schism discredit the church in the minds of many
- Huge building ventures of the Church required great amounts of money -- the
official Church came to be associated with financial exactions

>[!example]
> The Avignon Papacy was known for being concerned with raising financial
> revenues to keep itself going

Because of the disillusion with the Church, people began to look to secular
institutions for political stability -- beginnings of the national state and
*nationalism* were stirring
- As nationalism increased, the state was set for the Protestant Rebellion,
which was both theological and political
- By the 15th century, plaugues, 100 year's war, and failed crusades left people
disillusioned and cynical; discontent with society XXX

#### Disillusionment and Loss of Confidence in Papacy
Anti papal feelings were on the increase

> [!example]
> Savonarola (Dominican, excommunicated in 1497) led the city of Flourence in
> revolt against the Pope and the Curia; demanded reform against papal wealth and
> opulence

#### Increasing nationalism-- resentment of "foreign" control
Spain -- secular government took over
England -- church controlled by government
France -- pope allowed King to name bishops
Germany -- still far more divided; local princes wanted independence
Old ideal of a unity of Christendom "Holy Roman Empire" XXX

#### Elements of the Renaissance which contributed to the Reformation
The natural sciences, in addition to their great contributions, also led to q
questioning of Scripture and miracles

Humanism -- though became more secular; theology lost some of its place of
prominence; focus on individuality and government; human powers and abilities
> [!example]
> St. Thomas More is a good example of Christian Humanism

Nominalism challenged scholastic metaphysics

More people reaching Scripture due to the printing press, which is an enormous
good, but often without guidance

XXX

Greater historical consciousness of early church through the reading of the
fathers

Overall increase in learning:

#### Scandalous Abuses in the church
Some real abuses: selling of indulgences with twisted explanations, simony,
nepotism, absenteeism, opulence of Renaissance popes

Some humanists began to see popular piety as superstition: rejected veneration
of saints, images, reliquaries, devotions, miracles, pilgrimages, indulgences



### Theological Foundations of the Reformation
#### 1. Rejection of Transubstantiation
Occurred in different ways and to different degrees among reformers

Luther retained "Real Presence," although only in the Liturgy (?)

Other reformers claimed only a "spiritual presence," or viewed the Eucharist
only as a "memorial" (mental recollection, not a remembrance which makes present)

This led to an exclusive symbolic view that rejected that the Eucharist is both
sign and reality

##### Liturgical Consequences
All rejected Eucharistic Adoption, Corpus Christi processions, and (most)
reservation of the Blessed Sacrament

In some circles, there occurred the elimination of acts of adoration towards the
Blessed Sacrament, like elevations, genuflection, kneeling, etc.

If the Eucharist is only a symbol, both parts of the symbol are seen as
*necessary* 
- Bread and wine -- if you only receive one, you only receive half of the symbol
- For Protestants, restoration of the chalice to the laity was a top matter,
because they wanted the fullness of symbolism, since that is primarily what the
understood it to be

For Catholics, there is (still) no theological difference between reception
under one species and receiving both
- **Doctrine of Concomitance** -- Catholic theology was always understood that
reception of one species included the full reception of Christ -- this is the
fruit of what was to be called Transubstantiation: that Christ is fully present
in Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity, in both species together and in each one
separately 

#### 2. Rejection of Eucharistic *Sacrifice* 
If Christ is not present, his offering is not present, nor can the faithful be
united to his offering

If Mass is not an offering to God, what is it? A remembrance for those present

Primary goal of the Mass became instruction and devotional edification

##### Liturgical Consequences
Altars ripped out and replaced by communion tables (the Church had always
understood it as both)

A movement away from Latin, since it destroys the only or main purpose of
liturgy since nobody understood it; hence the *necessity* of the vernacular

Decline in frequency of celebrations (varied according to tradition)

Greater emphasis on the reading of Scripture, preaching, and catechesis as the
chief components of worship
- didactic and verbal, not a participation in the mystery of Christ

Replacement of the Eucharist by a sermon

Pulpits moved to the center, with just a small table beneath the pulpit for the
celebration of communion

Priest not offering sacrifice for the people, but only instructing them, and so
facing them as a lecturer

Preaching services became the norm; and depending on the tration receiving
communion was rare

XXX

#### 3. Rejection of the Ministerial Priesthood
If there is no sacrifice in worship, there is no need for the priesthood. There
would only have been considered a baptismal priesthood.

##### Liturgical Consequences
Ordained ministry retained, but only for the ministry of the Word

Layman could preside at communion; only for "good order" was this not done

Rejection of the sacraments
- Those who retained any retained baptism and Eucharist

If no sacrifice and no priesthood, there was no need for the Canon or
Eucharistic prayer
- No epiclesis needed since there is no Transubstantiation, so the Holy Spirit
was not invoked, except on the people
- Rods of Institution replaced the Canon

> [!NOTE]
> Turn from prayer to a mechanical formular; words of medieval "magical" view of
> the words. 


### Individual Reformed Traditions

There is a great variety -- the reformation was not a unified movement; there
were many different theologies leading to many different Liturgical changes
- Spectrum of conservative to radical liturgical changes
- Liturgy used as a means to advance the theological ideas of various movements
- Works of individuals
- Most lost the liturgy of the Hours entirely
- emphasis on communion as merely a fellowship supper

#### Anglican
Initially the most conservative
- Under Henry VII, no visible change -- only replaced name of the Pope with the
King, but it was silent, so nothing appeared different

Real change came with the death of Henry and the work of Thomas Cranmer
- 1549 -- Book of Common prayer, somewhat conservative
- 1552 -- radically protestant; abolished elevation, reservation; kept kneeling
for Communion, but an explanation ("the black rubric") stated that this was not
for reverence of the Sacrament but as a sign of humility and thankfulness 
    - Knox insisted on people standing for Communion as a way of denying the
    Real Presence
    - Never a question in the East XXX

#### Luther (d. 1546)

Retained the idea of Real presence, though rejected Transubstantiation (inferred
consubstantiation)
- consequently, some of his ideas are fairly traditional, but others are radical

Key concept was **Adiaphora** (indifferent)
- Things not necessary, but not forbidden: vestments, candles, etc.
> [!quote]
> Here we retain the vestments, altar, and candles until they are used up,
> or we are pelased to make a change. But we do not oppose anyone who would do
> otherwise. (LW 53.69)

Congregational hymns -- central to Luther's idea of Liturgy

*Forumula Missae* (1523) -- patterned on the order of the Mass; parts still in
Latin, but offertory prayers eliminated and Canon purged of every reference to
sacrifice 

*Deutsche Messe* (German Mass -- 1526) -- radical changes
- no Canon at all, only the words of Institution, and sung so they could be
heard by all (innovation of Luther)
- Words over the bread, then bread distributed; then the Sanctus; then words
over the cup, and it was distributed
- This didn't last, even in Lutheranism XXX

#### John Calvin (d. 1564)
Reformation in Geneva

Preaching service was an independent whole, to which the Lord's supper could be
attached
- Calvin desired the celebration of the Lord's supper every Sunday, but never
succeeded in convincing others

The pulput was his model of liturgy; the order of Mass disappeared
- After: intercessions,, creed, during witch elements prepared
- Then words of Institution, fraction during the Words, long exhortation,
distribution of Communion

Liturgy as a dialogue or interaction of priest/epople was not present
- Watching the liturgy was reokaced with listening
- Liturgy became didactic -- symbolic action impoverished
- All images should disappear. in order to focus attention upon the preaching
- Worship becomes a lecture; the church becomes a lecture hall; vestments
replaced XXX

#### Bucer and Zwingli
##### Martin Bucer in Strasbourg (d. 1551)
Had influence on Calvin and Cranmer

User of table instead of altar

Use of vernacular as the central feature

Whole service conducted from the pulpit, except for distribution of the bread
and wine

##### Ulrich Zwingli in Zurich (d. 1531)
More of the more radical of protestants

Wanted the Lord's Supper only four times  year

Second service added to the Pulpit service, with elements of the old Mass, but
randomly chosen

People remained seated, and Communion passed to them

### Middle Ages and the Protestant Reformation

Protestant reformers were not successful liturgists
- IN the middle ages, the balance between the word and sacrament had been lost,
nut ion the long run the reformers did not succeed in restoring it 
- The Word of God was rediscovered,but the altar was torn down

> [!important]
> The retained and expanded the most questionable contributions of medieval
liturgical devotion and practices XXX

##### Weaknesses of the Middle Ages retained, expanded and twiested
Pulpit service aside from mass → now almost exclusively the pulpit

Pass attendance of the faithful, not involved in the action of the Mass → here
just as passive, but now mainly with the word and lecture

Diminished understanding of the preface as *eucharistia* → now in Luther,
Calvin, and others a rejection of the preface altogether

XXX

In addition to a dogmatic defense of doctrine, the liturgy too needed reform
- the former was the *primary* 
- (but not the only) focus of Trent
