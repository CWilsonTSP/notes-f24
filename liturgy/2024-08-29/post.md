When reflecting on the chapter, I was drawn back to what Pitre said on the second paragraph-- he quotes a rabbi from the 3rd century saying "In the World to Come all sacrifices will be annulled, but the thanksgiving sacrifice will never be annulled." The insight of course is that Christ's sacrifice on Calvary was a sacrifice once but for all, as the righteous for the unrighteous. But the way in which this is carried out is in a constantly present re-presentation of that one sacrifice at the Mass.
