### Liturgy in the Old Testament 

#### The importance of the study of the Jewish Liturgy

- The practices and significance of the Liturgy if the new covenant flows directly from the Jewish liturgy's feasts and customs
    - There  was a covenant before this, and it is from this that the new comes
- intrinsic connections
    - OT - like the NT is the revealed word of God
    - Passover - The last Supper was the first Eucharist
        - Jesus chose this context specifically
    - Temple worship - the basis of New Covenant liturgical theology
        - IN Jesus' words: Destroy this temple... I will build it up
        - Yam Kapor has been realized by this One High Priest
    - Jewish religious meals - the basis of the first Christian celebrations of the Eucharist
- Jesus who instituted the New Covenant was a Jew, faithful in every letter to the Law of Moses including its liturgy
    - Apostles and all first converts were Jewish
    - In the first century, there was a regular Christian presence at the temple and synagogue
    - Initially Christians were seen as a branch of Judaism
- A clear break eventually occurred that sharply distinguised Jews and Christians
    - CHristians were expelled from the Temple and synagogues
    - Destruction of the Temple in 70 AD
    - Polemics against the Jews in ancient Christian writings
- Yet, to ignore or downplady the Jewish roots of the Christian Liturgy is to ignore God's revelation and the history of salvation
    - "Spiritually, we are Semites" -- PS Pius XI

| Jewish Worship | Christian Worship | 
| --------------- | --------------- | 
| Temple | Daily Sacrifice, daily prayers, Passover,  Liturgy of the House |
| synagogue | Item2.2 | 
| home | Daily Prayers, Passover | 

#### The Tabernacle
- The tabernacle was moderled after Moses' vision o =f heaven and was a sign of God's presence among the people, with them on their journey [[Exodus 30]]
    - The Levites were responsible for divine worship and the furnishings of the Tabernacle

##### Organization of the Temple
- Outer Court
    - Altar of sacrifice
    - Bronze laver for ritual washing
    - Tabernacle tent
- The Holy Place
    - Golden lamp stand (menorah)
    - table for the bread of the Presence

There was a big transformation between the Tent Temple worship and Solomon's Temple worship

> 3 temples? Original tent, Solomon, Herod

### The Temple
#### Daily Sacrifices
- Temple was the center for Jewish sacrifice and religious life, commanded by God
- sacrifices happened every day
- meaning of daily sacrifices (morning and evening):
    1. Offering a gift to please God and seeking God's help: burnt offering
        - holocaust = complete burnt offering
    2. Entering into communion with God by sharing a meal: creates a bond
    3. Shedding of blood released power of life: 
        - Leviticus -- the life of every creature is its blood
        - God commanded animals in substitution
    4. To atone for an offense by giving up something precious; animal

> firstborn -- Jewish emphasis is someone who has the highest role in the family second to the father. So offering the firstborn son is important...

#### Kinds of Sacrifices
- *korban*  -- sacrifce, offering, "to draw near"
- **burnt offering**  (Holocaust: entirely burnt) -- commune with God, expiate sins, and submit to the will of God
- **peace offering**
    - exoress thanks or gratitude to God for his bounties and mercies, some burnt, some eaten by the priest, and some eaten by the offerer and his family
    - includes thanksgiving offerings (*Todah*, obligatory for survivors of life-threatening crises), free-will offerings, and offerings made in fulfillment of a vow
- **sin**  - atone for unintentional sins
- **guilt** - when there was doubt if one committed sin
- **food** - devotion to God for the fruits of the earth

#### Bread of Presence
- Israelites places the bread of the presence, flagons for wine, and incense on a table of acacia wood covered in gold
    - 12 loaves, for the tribes
    - "bread and wine" of the presence
    - wine was not poured out but drunk in a sacred meal
    - renewed every Sabbath as a most holy  sacrifice of the everlasting Covenant
        - Done by the Levites
- translations:
    - Showbread, bread of display, bread of offering, bread of the presence
        - each connote the bread being placed before God's presence in the Holy of Holies
        - the word for presence *panim* literally translates as "face"
    - Literal translation would be "bread of the face"
        - the bread of the face of God; ie a sign of God's face
        - Pitre -- a memorial of Moses and the elder's experience seeing God and eating and drinking at Mt. Sinai
- Theological developments
    - **Melchizedek** -- his offering of bread and wine is connected to the bread of the presence [[Gen 14]]
        - meaning this offering is more ancient than the Exodus offerings 
    - **Holy Sacrifice** -- the bread of the presence is a *most holy sacrifice*
        - loaves baked with small pieces of dough on the sides like the horns of the altar of sacrifice
            - shows this bread is also a sacrifice, like the animals
        - before the bread was brought int the holy place it could be laid on marble but afterwars it had to be laiz on gold
            - [[Ez 41:21|Ezekiel refers to the golden table of the Bread of the Presence as an "altar"]]
        - while inside the tabernacle the menorah had to be lit continually
        - Supernatural properties: even a small portion of it could provide miraculous healing (Talmud)
- **Displaying the bread of the presence** - as a sign of God's love and covenant
    - Only the priests were allowed to see the sanctuary, we find in the Jewish and Babylonian Talmud that at each of the three Pilgrim feats, the priest would remove the table of the bread of the presence so that pilgrims could see it
    "They used to lift it up and exhibit the bread of the presence on it to those who came up for the festival saying to them, *behold, God's love for you!* " (Babylonian Talmud M. 92a)
- Obvious and profound continuity in the bread of the presence and the Holy Eucharist

#### Daily prayers and Jewish feasts
- Religion of Time
    - the Semitic purpose behind certain hours of prayer and their series of festivals was the sanctification of time
    - dedicate all time to God

3. spread the blood of the lamb on the home
    - practice ceased over time

5. every year, keep the Passover as a "day of remembrance" of the Exodus
    - seen as a way of participating in the first Exodus

- Sabbath services but also study and prayers during the week

example prayers:

2. Sabbath hymn of praise in thanksgiving for creation and God's guidance of Israel
3. Prayer of 18 petitions (*Shemone Esre/Amidah*)
- "Lord, open my kips, and my mouth will proclaim your praise"
    - Jesus would have prayed this in the synagogue
- included 3 blessings, 12 intercessions, 3 blessings
    - basis for the eucharistic prayer sin the Didache
- certain prayer services

#### Homes
Religious life in homes centered on prayer.

- Daily prayer
