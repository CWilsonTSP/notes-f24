- Art, Architecture, and music
- Attempts at Liturgical Growth
- Tensions among Currents of Thought


### Overview of Developments and Tensions
#### Historical Overview
17th and 8th centuries

Not much development i the liturgy itself; yet there were extensive shifts in
the context of the liturgy
- Triumphalist attitude in Christian theology and art
- Architecture -- Baroque churches, open sanctuaries, large tabernacles
- Music -- elaborate concerns
- fixed form -- emphasis and "science" of rubrics

> [!aside] 
> Rubrics themselves as such aren't really considered until xx

- Spirituality and devotion -- new saints and instructive meditations (not
allegories) on the liturgy

Tensions between intellectual and artistic currents of thought, and between the
aesthetic and ascetic 
- Theology and art
- ascetic Jansenism, devotion, and sensuality
- Uniformity and accessibility
- Triumphalism, Classicism, Rationalism
- Baroque, Rococo, and Gothic
- Reformism and Restorationism

#### Catholic Counter-Reformation
The counter reformation was marked by a spirit of Triumphalism, exuberance,
enthusiasm, spiritual vitality, and missionary zeal; (missions to both the new
and the old worlds)
- Blossoming of scholastic studies
- Theological defenses (controversialist and apologetical) of Eucharistic
sacrifice and ministerial priesthood marked by Protestant rejections
- Jesuits took leading role: interest was primarily in theology
- Glorifying the Church (compensation for attacks); church reveled in and
lavished in and *emphasized all the values rejected by the Protestants*

No significant development of the liturgical rite itself; only the externals and
how they were performed; xxx


### Art, Architecture, and music

#### Art
Baroque art and architecture is ultimately a revival of imperial Roman forms of
architecture
- "whirling maelstrom of sensations and ideas"
- Characterized by a voluptuous treatment of the body; Gothic was lean and
chaste; Baroque is sensuous and full-bodied (against the puritan culture)
- In the Renaissances the classical Roman culture reasserts itself; a rejection
of the Gothic (the Franco-Germanic influence)


There began to be a concern especially among the Jesuits to openly display the
sacrifice and bring bring the altar closer to the people
- Choirs moved from the front to the back of the church
- no seating in side aisles
- open, impressive architectural spaces
- Altars magnificent and prominent, without rood screens
- Large tabernacles occupying the most conspicuous spaces

Common people could share in the splendor of the royal court -- only in the
Church was this possible 

#### Music
Became a dominant element of the liturgy
- Some have described it as "church concerts with liturgical accompaniment"
(Jung., 149)
- Music and architecture dwarfed the liturgy -- the experience of the liturgy
was like an opera
- The form was fixed; the chief elaboration was not in liturgy as such but in
the additions to the Mass
- Liturgy became the setting for artistic expression

The Musical style was operatic and dramatic, the accent was on display and
theatricality in music (and in architecture)
- Period of great composers, such as Bernardi, Heinrich Biber, and Bach

#### Liturgical Practices
In this period, non-communicating at Mass was common
- The accent was not on participation in the Eucharistic Sacrifice, but on
seeing the spectacle
- Adoration of Christ's Presence became the only goal of attending Mass;
exposition often took place during Mass
- Communion was seen as an act of devotion, and when it occurred it was usually
outside of Mass

There was little sense that the faithful had a part to play in the prayer of the
priest
- The stress was not on what was common ad what connected the priest and the
people, but on what differentiated them; this was in reaction to the Protestant
rejection of the priesthood
    - The idea grew that the Canon is something only the priest could enter
    - NO translations -- though not codified in the law, the Latin prayers were
    not to be given to the faithful, eventually they were put into the index

#### The Parish Mass
Only one per Sunday in each church, though many churches
- Hour determinded by synodl statutues

The principal Mass was sung
- Laymen allowed to take liturgical roles (even up to sub-deacon) if there were
no clerics available; priests could act as deacon and sub-deacon at Solemn High
Masses

Churches still used the pulpit service or "prone", following the medieval
practice, which was inserted after the Gospel: intercessory prayers,
announcements, and *instruction* 

Communions were so rare that they were done separately after Mass, for those who
wished to stay
- Eventually, an early "communion mass" was celebrated for those who wished to
receive
- A rite of blessed bread became common at the end of Mass

Daily parish Mass was not common except in monasteries, educational
institutions, and the royal courts


### Attempts at Liturgical Growth
New editions of the Missal published in 1604 (Clement VIII) and in 1634 (Urban
VIII); minor revisions

Liturgical uniformity tended to make the gap between popular piety and the
liturgy wider

Pastoral concerns led St. Charles Borromeo (d. 1584), St. Francis de Sales (d.
1622), and others like them to instruct people to appreciate and enter into the
liturgy
- To help people gain a true understanding on the Eucharist
- Liturgical commentaries -- mediations which referred to the action and prayers
of the mass
> [!quote] St. Francis de Sales, *Introduction to the Devout Life* 
>  From the beginning until the priest goes up to the altar, make your
> preparation with him. This consists in placing yourself in the presence of God,
> acknowledging your unworthiness, and begging pardon for your sins.

Benedictines of Saint-Maur published an explanation of the ceremonies, based on
historical research 

Germans had a custom of vernacular hymns, even prior to the Reformation; this
gained great impetus because of the Lutheran challenge
- Songs at gradual, offertory, and communion even during a low Mass

Cardinal Pierre de BÃ©rulle (d. 1629) fostered mediation on participation in the
oblation of Christ in the Mass
- Private prayer was related to the public liturgy

In Germany (Mainz, 1660), a "biblical Catechism" gave an explanation of the
sacrifice of the Mass with instruction on how to unite one's prayer at Mass with
the priest

In France, there was an attempt to have a French translation of the Missal which
was met with official opposition 
- Condemned in 1661 by Pope Alexander VII

The Baroque aesthetic and artistic movement continued and developed into Rococo.



### Tensions among Currents of Thought

#### Currents of Thought in the 18th century
##### Jansenism
Catholic Calvinism, moral and acetic rigidity, unworthiness, human sinfulness

Devotions to the Sacred Heart and Holy Eucharist were used to combat this.

##### Enlightenment Rationalism
Philosophical and political movement which led to a cold intellectualism

Cult of saints and the miraculous in everyday life were used to combat i

##### Classicism
Principles of culture, art, and literature of Ancient Greece and Rome marked by
simplicity, clarity, and strong restraint on emotions; this was a restrained
reaction to Baroque excess

##### Nationalism
Inspired further feelings of independence, revolution, and political discord,
particularly strong in France where a sense of Gallican independence was
fostered.

#### Reformism

These currents of though also led to reformist movements within the Catholic
Church.

Unfortunately, some attempts at renewal were not particularly loyal to the holy
See, and so they were doomed to failure, because they came from the wrong
motives.

> [!example]
> Pasquier Quesnel advocated liturgical reforms such as praying the Canon aloud;
> he was a Jansenist which discredited them

Some tried saying the canon aloud; an episcopal prohibition was issued in 1698;
some encouraging the people (rather than just servers) to say the responses

Neo-Gallican Missals published by individual french bishops
- Not Gallican rite; Roman Rite, but with adaptations
- Missal of Maeux (1709) -- the red-printed "R" in the missal
- A Missal in Troyes (1736) proposed that the priest not repeat parts said by
other ministers
- Increased use of Biblical material
- increased number if prefaces
- A desire to return to the simplicity of the early Roman rite
- participation of the faithful

##### Northern Italy
- Restoration of sermon
- increase of communion by the faithful
- No instrumental music (concert-type)
- restoration of offertory procession, kiss of peace, and concelebration
- Synod of Pistoia (1786) proposed only one altar in each church, use of the
vernacular, discontinuation of private masses
    - Some of these were too radical

#### Restoration
Excessive enthusiasm for reform reached an end as the French Revolution
discredited many reformist proposals
- Even healthy aims were viewed with suspicion because they had emanated form
the time period of the Enlightenment

Rationalism gave way to Romanticism in the 1800's
- Renewed interest in the middle ages: a Gothic revival in architecture;
Gregorian chant and Palestrina in music; a rejection of Baroque excesses

Return to complete affirmation of dogma and the supernatural (against
Enlightenment Philosophers), to a renewed respect for the hierarchic structure
of the Church, and a renewed reverence for and exploration of tradition
- Oxford movement in England (1833) -- Catholic Restoration
- Vatican I (1870)
- General rejection of liturgical independence
