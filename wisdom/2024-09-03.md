> Davidic â‰  David wrote, but that it concerns him

### Approaching the Psalter
#### Names
Psalmos (Gk.) -- "songs"
Tehillim (Heb.) -- "praises"
    - Who they are directed towards XXX
    - first book == many lamentations
    - They are all oriented towards praise, and should be read as such

> So, we should not expect "happy happy joy joy" in all the psalms


#### Titles
Superscriptions -- titles that are attached to the head of a psalm
- provide attribution, association, and/or musical direction
- are in the most ancient copies of the texts we have

#### Davidic Text
David introduced, composed, narrated, or is a attributed to
> David is a son, around which the entire Psalter revolves

Everything is done by David -- reform, reconstruction, suffering, kingship, etc.

So the association is with David for all the Psalms, in part because of the
connection between the Davidic king and the definitive Son of David

#### OT Narrative Context
- covenant historical background
- import of Davidic covenant
- key covenant characteristics

##### import of Davidic covenant
- See handout
[[ 2 Sam 7]] 
- David having ascended the throne, now having a united nation
- David will remain, Sons will rule in his place after him

##### key covenant characteristics
- See handout

#### Structure of the Psalter
Five books:
1. 1-41
2. 42-72
3. 73-89
4. 90-106
5. 107-150

> Pietre 566 -- rough narrative flow
> If we take seriously the roughness of this narrative flow, then it works ok. 
> But if we take it as strict narrative flow, it becomes a problem

We can treat the Psalms as a summary of all Revelation, but also as something
unique 
There is a dynamic of "Christoformity" that Athanasius is pointing out

Take serious the veiled presence of Christ in all scripture, especially in the
OT and the Psalms
But this also requires to attend to detailed exegesis of the text, cultivating
the exegetical skills
