## Approaching Psalms and Wisdom Literature
### shared sapiential and moral focus and shared poetic genre
Both Psalms and wisdom literature show a binding concern for human conduct and morality, both in the specifics of moral action and in the deep disparity between wickedness and righteousness

These books exhibit a shared commitment to:
1. existence of a moral order
2. natural discernability of this moral order
3. recognition of true results/outcomes of human action

> when and how is the true result of human action actually attained?
> The wicked prosper and the righteous do not

Wisdom as a "gubernatorial perfection," enabling possessors to order rightly all that falls within their care and responsibility.
- "governing perfection"
- Gods wisdom is concerned and posited on the basis of his righter ordering of the created world and his providential ordering of things to their proper and befitting ends
- human wisdom concerns BOTH discernment of God's order AND alignment of one's life and responsibilities within this order

##### shared poetic genre
Unlike other forms of poetry, Hebrew poetry is defined not by the use of rhyme or meter, but by:
1. Parallelism within and between poetic "lines"
2. abundant use of imagery (e.g., metaphor, simile) 
> By imagery, do we just mean literary devices?
> Hebrew poetry tends to be verse terse. It is not prose.


#### What defines Hebrew Poetry?

#### line units and their elements
a line is not necessarily a sentence or verse, butis instead a unit comprised of smaller parts called "cola":

> the whitespace in the bibles are reflective of the way it was written

##### Types of cola

| name      | description | looks like                                   | example     |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| monocolon | one colon   | --------<br><br>                             | [[Ps 2#1]]1 |
| bicola    | two cola    | --------<br>  ------<br>                     |             |
| tricola   | three cola  | --------<br>  ------<br>  ------             | Ps. 2:2     |
| quatrain  | four cola   | --------<br>  ------<br>--------<br>  ------ | Ps. 1:1     |


#### Use of Parallelism
A primary dynamic presence within and across line units of Hebrew poetry is "parallelism", which may be of three basic kinds:
1. Synonymous parallelism
    - Expressing similar ideas
    - Not *really*  saying the same thing multiple times
    - More like ≌ than =
    - [[Ps 95#1]], [[Ps 95#4]]-5
2. Antithetical parallelism
    - Expressing opposed ideas
    - A !~= B
    - [[Ps 95#7]]b-8, [[Prov 14#1]], [[Prov 26#4]]-5
3. Synthetic parallelism
    - Expressing a development of ideas
    - A → B
    - [[Ps 95#11]], [[Ps 95#10]]-11

#### "Abundant Imagery"
The other primary dynamic present in Hebrew poetry is the abundant use of imagery, which itself entrails a form of parallelism or likeness between the figure of speech employed an its proper, literal referent.

Examples:
- [[Ps 23 |shephard and sheep imagery in Psalm 23, turing to festive imagery]]
    - sheep tend to thrive in a domesticated setting, but they only do that with the guidance of a shephard.
    - So too is it like God and Israel with God's kingship
- [[ Ps 19 | praise through the earth for the law and the prophets]]
    - Presents the created order as evangelistic
    - praise for the law
        - law into fine gold
        - law as sweet like honey
- [[ Ps 95 | today if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts]]
    - already a stone image of stony hearts
    - but also recalling the past (*today if you hear his voice* )



### Location Within the Old Testament
#### In Old Testament Canon
Psalms stand at the end of history books and before prophets

#### In Salvation Historical Narrative
Psalms stand outside of the historical narrative.

> Many are called Psalms of David even if not written by David

They also reference material earlier in the Canon (David, Solomon, creation, etc.)

> Many prophetic elements connected to the Son of David

#### Importance of "Covenant"
Covenant is very important

Israel is brought out of Egypt so to enter into a covenant with The Lord

> You can take the Israel out of Egypt, but you can't take the Egypt out of Israel
> "He takes them from death in Egypt just to kill them creatively in the desert" -- Hahn

Definition of covenant in Old Testament/Ancient Near East:
1. a mutual agreement
2. with terms and stipulations
3. establishing a kinship bond
4. ratified by oath-swearing

Different types of covenant:
1. parity
    - equal parties, establishing mutual obligation
2. vassal
    - unequal parties, with onus on the lesser party
3. grant
    - unequal parties, with onus on the greater party

Major Covenants:
1. Adam
    - Sabbath
    - family
2. Noah
    - Rainbow
    - clan
3. Abraham
    - Circumcision
4. Moses
    - Passover
5. David
    - Temple
6. Jesus
    - Eucharist
