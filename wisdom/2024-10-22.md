## Ecclesiastes

#### Quoheleth
'One who calls out' assembled 
- Son of David
- King of Jerusalem
- self-identified as knowing wisdom
- king over all Israel
- All of this together directs us to an identification of Quoheleth as Solomon

Perhaps not Solomon that wrote, but... it certainly critiques him

The sense of vanity in Ecclesiastes is more emptiness or a lack of content,  but
the word itself is closer to breath or vapour(?) but it isn't some kind of
nihilism; There is an impermanence which has an element of permanence;
"everything under the sun" passes.

hebel hebeleim -- vanity of vanity, breath of breaths, the most vape like

Order moves into disorder, and this is more of an indication of the fragility of
what man can can attempt to enjoin on himself in his earthly life

Comparative "better than" sayings can only be made on the basis of a recognition
of an underlying good or at least a distinction on a moral hierarchy of these
things

#### Limitations of knowledge
Are these expressions expressing Gnosticism or a sober limit of knowledge?

#### fear and judgment
