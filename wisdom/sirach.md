### Authorship and Intention
This book has an prologue written by the author's grandson

Sirach recognizes the basic division of law, prophets, and writings that we recognize in the Old Testament today.

According to the prologue, the author wanted to deliberately instruct in wisdom.

Prologue notes that there are differences in the translations. 

Around 132 BC is when the grandson is writing, so Bergsa Pitre suggest it was written 70 prior to that.

Written to assist those in the diaspora -- published for those who live abroad and speak other languages.

### Relation to earlier wisdom literature
Among the wisdom literature, Sirach is most related to Proverbs. Both Sirach and Proverbs give instruction, but Sirach affords greater breadth and depth, unlike proverbs.

#### Continuities
Personification of Lady Wisdom as a maternal figure.

Resumption and amplification of proverbs relating to the fear of the Lord.

#### Developments
Connection of Wisdom and Law

### Consideration of teaching
#### depiction of "fear"
Sirach talks about fear of the Lord _a lot._ Fear of the Lord is indicated as the starting and ending point of Wisdom.

Loving obedience in the measure of growing in fear of the Lord is indicative of growth in wisdom.

#### Divine Retribution
In contrast to Job and Wisdom, Sirach does not seem to be as concerned with retribution. However, it does underlie much of its poetry and instruction. 

Doing right or righteous things is indicative of receiving blessing.

#### Concern with Relationships
Sirach talks much about relationships, which are firstly and already blessings from God.

It foregrounds an inability to know where you stand before God: those beloved by God can be brought low because of their sin, and likewise those who have no sin (Job). 

##### Parents
Much of this ends up helps be supporting text for St. Thomas on Piety.

Makes explicit the obligation of children towards parents.

Honoring both as obedience and a lifelong glorification of a parent. They serve as potential images for God, in the the honor due to a parent is reflective of that due to God, and likewise forsaking your parents in reflective of forsaking God.


##### Spouses
Exhortation of chastity and avoidance of adultery.

Do not associate with a woman singer -- Sir. 9:4


##### Friendship
"friends need to be tested?"

Discernment of friends from enemies.

##### Importance of almsgiving
Almsgiving has import throughout the book, having little tidbits sprinkled in about how bloody good it is, like a well-meaning sprinkle of sea salt on your chocolate bar.

Makes clear it is Good to image God in this particular way. (ch. 7)

Almsgiving: a recognition of what you have received from God, and to repay Him through your proximates, especially your parents who are proximates of God.  Also pay your ~~priests~~ seminarians.

### Instruction for Proficient
#### Framing of "momento mori"
- 28:6
- 38:20-22
- 40:1 -- anxiety about death

Direct address of death rather than an exhortation to remember death
- 41:1-4




#### Wisdom and the Law
Sirach, perhaps, underscores this relationship more than the otherwise books

##### Created and uncreated wisdom
Mosaic law vs natural law

Four expressions of Created Wisdom
- Law
- angels
- Christ's human nature
- Our Lady
- grace

24 -- engagement with wisdom and the law

There is an emphasis in Sirach on the createdness of wisdom
Unlike the book of Wisdom, Sirach IS talking about created wisdom.

Created wisdom == Mosaic law. Positive divine law. Having a place in time.

Created wisdom is expressive of but not exhaustive of uncreated wisdom.

##### Fulfillment in Christ
Something about Christ in John 6 and lady wisdom in Sirach providing good?

A fostering of hunger and thirst for God the Word, that the Law is given to provide

> sir 28:40: I wisdom have poured out rivers.
> mfw: sad pepe

>[!quote] Dr. Michael Hahn
>For better or for worse there is no scripture study in heaven...  I'm a little disappointed.

> [!question]+ If created wisdom in Sirach is the created law, what would be the significance of Sirach 24:9 -- for eternity I shall not cease to exist?
> Taking the language from Proverbs 8, and applying it to that which is created in time.
> God has it in mind to reveal himself from all eternity, and has been from the beginning of creation.

> [!aside]
> **Hahn**: Even though we reverence Christ in the Scriptures, we don't reverence Him in the same way that we do in the Eucharist.
> **Me**: Yeah, I don't eat bibles

#### Sirach and Priestly Formation
> Strap in, bois. We're ~~freaking a guinea pig~~ freaking guinea pigs.

##### Human Dimension
Sirach is *obviously and at length* concerned with the practice of virtue, especially concerning friendships, relationships, public piety, and presenting as a public person. Concern with manners

##### Spiritual Dimension
Can be reduced to: fear of the Lord; loving obedience. 

Focus on the virtue of chastity and EEEEEVIL WOMEN (but also guarding your heart)

##### Intellectual Dimension
Attentiveness to God's works, especially creation

Especially: 38-39; wisdom of the scribes and study of the Law. Immersed in the mysteries and figures of scripture. 

##### Pastoral Dimension

Discipline and harshness are themselves an expression of love for those who still need formation.

Almsgiving

Showing mercy
