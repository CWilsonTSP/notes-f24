## Wisdom continued

### Outline?

#### Continued look at interpretive options
1. Exclusively human love
    - predominate secular view
2. Divine love
3. Messianic love
4. Mystical love
5. liturgical love 
> 6. Our Lady

We had taken a look at different near-east poetic comparisons, in which each of
them lends to these interpretations in more similar or more different ways. 

Reapplication-- 
> idk what this means but HERE WE GO!

##### Dreaming motif
Within scripture, dreams are significant.

The Lord speaks to all the prophets in dreams, but to Moses face to face.

Connection to Solomon -- in dreams

St. Joseph -- dreams

So if God speaks to his people in dreams, we can consider the dream imagery in
SoS as prophetic f an everlasting nuptial union with God

#### Bernard of Clarivaux (1090 - 1153)
- wrote 86 sermons on the SoS; got up to 3:1
- "Mellifuous doctor"

Presupositions:
1. is scripture, and inspired 
    - Concerns divine things
    - Concerns Christ and the Church
2. Need for attentiveness to figural expressions
3. His effort is to interpret those things that are obscure with an eye to what
   is more plainly taught elsewhere in scripture

SoS 1:1 Kiss of his mouth is the incarnation

> TLDR:
> A kiss means you love someone and SoS is about God's love. Why is he going on
> about this send help
