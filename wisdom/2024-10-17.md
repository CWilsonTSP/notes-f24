### Pedagogy of proverbs/figures
mashal: proverb/"figure of speech"

1. Hear and do
2. Study and understand
    - Stand-alone takeaways/statements
    - unity and connectedness
    - Paradigm of parallelism
        - studding these kinds of observations establishes the sorts of habits
        of observation, habits of understanding and are encouraged by it, that is
        to say, when one studies especially the antithetical parallelism, though
        it isn't the only thing going on here, one tends to find parallelism
        going on everywhere, where we can find many kinds of parallelism that
        correspond to other places.
3. Teach, conceal, and reveal

Dr. Hahn talking for 15 minutes about Proverbs 14:7,
saying the same thing 12 times:
 _________________________________________
/ And here, patience is patient and folly \
\ is foolish                              /
 -----------------------------------------
    \
     \
    ^__^         /
    (oo)\_______/  _________
    (__)\       )=(  ____|_ \_____
        ||----w |  \ \     \_____ |
        ||     ||   ||           ||
