#### Cycle 2 -- 120-136
Psalm of assent -- gradual psalms 

The liturgical setting is in connection to literal annual pilgrimage

The dynamic of pilgrimage is probably significant

120 -- Psalmist identifies as someone who sojourns 

#### Imprecatory psalms
cf. Handout

"Perfect hatred is cause for venting ones spleen"

What is the target of the cursing?

These psalms are an attunement of the Psalmist's will with God's will

137 -- don't bash babies, kids 
- wickedness is to be destroyed by the Lord and his anointed 
- seeds of sin (bash them when they're little and cute and seemingly manageable,
and surely the could do no harm)

#### conlcuding wrap up
1. Todah shape of the Psalter -- start and end with praise
2. posture of sojourn -- lament psalms; present affliction is a pressing
   concern; and yet this is in some sense overcome with future Zion focused
   praise
3. Future-orientation of the Psalter 
- Coming of the promised anointed one (check lmao get wrecked)
- Glory of the heavenly Jerusalem
