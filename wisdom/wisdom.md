### Meditative re-reading of the OT
####  Examples in 10 and 1-6
####  Initial gains
### Polemic Against Idolatry
> [!def] Polemic
> Of or pertaining to controversy; maintaining or involving controversy


#### Negative account
Account of where the idols come from
- something about a woodcutter?

15 -- potter with the soft earth -- making gods out of something you can crush
with your hands

- He who makes idols know more than anyone what he is doing is wrong? 

14 -- Penalty for idolatry -- 

#### Positive account



###  More Meditative re-Reading
Starting with wisdom 10:15 and start of ch. 11; aside on the merciful punishment
of the wicked; plagues and provisions

#### Underlying theology
There seems to be an underlying theology of retribution

1. God is creator and ruler of all
2. God's mercy towards all (11:23-24)
3. God corrects and warns (12:2)
4. "One is punished by the very things in which one sins" (11:16)
    - In the judgment, God will give you what you want and it will be utterly
    unfulfilling 
5. God both disciplines and judges (11:9)
    - The Egyptians used the Nile (water, a place of life) as a place of death
     for the Israelite boys, but when God makes it an actual place of death,
     they would rather it be a place of life.
    - Contrasted, God leads the Israelites to a rock in the desert and gives
    them water (life) from that which would normally bring death
6. "God's grace and mercy are with his elect" (3:9, 4:15)
    - This is the Summation at the end of the Book:
    > For in everything, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people; and
    > thou hast not neglected to help them at all times and in all places. 


#### Antithetical pairings
Contrasts between the righteous and the enemies

| Regarding | Righteous | Enemies |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Thirst (11) | Water from rock | River of blood |
| Hunger (16) | Quail(?) | Frogs |
| Health (16) | Bronze serpent | lethal gnats and flies |
| Weather (16) | Manna | Fiery hail |
| Vision (17) | Pillar of light and the law| Plague of darkness |
| Firstborn (18) | Deliverance | Death |
| The Sea (19) | Salvation | Destruction |


#### (in)accuracy of re-reading?
> [!question] How aptly does Wisdom's characterization of the Israelites during the Exodus reflect them?
> Not really that well...
 
Well, Israel and Egypt aren't named, so it could be totally analogous. 

We can think of Israel and Egypt rather as figures, as the Chosen people and the
oppressors of Egypt. This entails the righteous as a corporate people rather
than individuals and makes comparisons between the righteous as God's sons and
the oppressors as those opposed to his sons. 


#### A Final Gain...

Hermenutic instruction
That is, a model for how to read OT narrative material in regard to 
1. Motive as revelatory of God and the nature of friendship with God
2. Method of reading these things as figures
