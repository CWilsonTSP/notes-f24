### Approaching Wisdom literature
#### Wisdom books
##### Patriarchal Period
- Job
    - dispute and divine retaliation
    - there is no Israel at this point

##### Monarchical Period
- Proverbs
    - Praise of wisdom and collection of moral instruction
- Ecclesiastes
    - Austere reflection on the fleetingness of life
- Song of Songs
    - Erotic poetry (?)

#### Key commonalities
Structure, maybe
Voice?
The exultation of righteousness

#### Proverbs as foundational
Encompasses most of the overlap commonalities from the wisdom literature
When we think of wisdom literature, this is what we think of
Job, though she story is set in a time before Solomon, takes many positions from
proverbs and discusses them

Has a sense of deeper integration with the rest of the canon of scripture

### Solomonic basis, background
These are all linked with Solomon in some way

Solomon not mentioned in Ecclesiastes though he says certain things that lends
us to thinking he is the author

The Davidic covenant is still in the background. Solomon stands as the first
fulfillment of many if not all of God's promises extended to David.

#### narrative considerations
#### depictions of wisdom
Wisdom as gubernatorial perfection -- it directs one to govern rightly 
- as exercised by man 
    - naturally acquired intellectual virtue
    - infused divine gift
    - revealed teaching that comes from God
- as exercised by God
    - foundational divine attribute
    - "This is wisdom that is the divine essence"
    - personified cooperator 

#### how wisdom is given and received 
Within the wisdom literature, it is in the context of parental instruction.
David given to Solomon, God as Father to Solomon, as Solomon as Father-King
sharing his instruction
The vehicle for this often involves figures of speech 

### Proverbs
#### contents, structure, and authorship
See handout, I guess

#### wisdom and "fear of the Lord"
Almost every chapter of the prologue of Proverbs mentions fear of the Lord

Several kinds of fear moving in order:
1. terrified fear of an enemy
2. Servile   fear of a  master
3. Reverent  fear of a  father

> We haven't had one of those good old fashioned Egyptian orgies in a while

#### parental torah and divine excursus 
Fear the Lord, not 'other gods'
