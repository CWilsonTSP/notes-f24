Poetic description of unconsummated desire

#### Authorship and Intent
Connection to Solomon 
- not discounting that he could be the author, but probably not

Interpretive options
1. Exclusive human love
    - This is the contemporary critical view
    - Poor shepherd boy, whose lover has been tapped by Solomon (poor shepherd)
2. Divine love
    - The Lord and the people/land
    - Jewish exegits
3. Messianic love
    - The Son of David and the people
4. "Mystical" love
    - God and the soul
    - Bulk of the Christian tradition
5. "Liturgical" love
    - God and the people united to him in worship

Possible meanings evident?
- literalistic
- typical
- Deeper figures 

Light from elsewhere?

- A.N.E. near parallels
    > Ancient near east 
    - Egyptian love poetry
        - beloved is addressed as sister and queen
        - never dialogical 
    - Sumerian cultic poetry
        - explicit

#### A plausible resolution...
