### O.T. Canon
Canon: 
- Greek: *kanon*; rank or measure
- The list of and/or what is contained in the biblical books
- Either as a table of contents or the contents themselves

[[School/classes/24-25/f24/rft/2024-08-27/2024-08-27#Biblical Canon|biblical canon]]
the thing about tradition and table of contents

#### Definition, divisions
main divisions of OT:
1. Law -- Torah
2. Prophets -- Nevi'im
3. Writings -- Ketuvim
    - Psalms and other books
Together this makes the *TaNaKh*

More recent (Christian?) division:
- according to genre:
    - Pentateuch
    - Historical books
    - Psalms and Wisdom
    - Prophets

> The canons tend to reflect what is read in the liturgy

> "The tallest blade of grass gets cut down first"

> Midterm Extra credit: name books of the bible in order
> You should probably learn this regardless of the EC

#### Canon formation
> Pietre gives a broad overview of the development

How did things become regarded as divinely inspired?

Formation of the Christian OT Canon:
- 4th century = official formation
    - this formation was not out of thin air;
    - this is what we proclaim because this is what we have received
- The inclusion stands as a function of the church's judgment
- Oldest list we have is from the 3rd century, which says almost the same thing

Deuterocanonical - etym: second canon
> Pietre 29. all of these are regarded as scripture from the beginning 
- All of them were either used or explicitly identified as scripture by the Church
Fathers

Florence and Trent -- codification of the canon
    - The church define things when she has to assert against false teaching
    - You don't need to codify what everyone agrees on

### Texts and translations
OT written in 3 languages:
1. Hebrew
2. Aramaic
    - Daniel
    - Tobit
3. Greek
    - Wisdom

#### Ancient versions of the OT
##### Original languages and ancient versions
> Bold indicate translations, not original 

| name             | language               | Date of Origin   | Oldest Surviving Copies |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Autographs       | Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek | ? - 100s BC      | N/A                     |
| Septuagint (LXX) | **Greek**              | 200s BC          | N/A                     |

| Vulgate          | **Latin**              | 300s AD          | 700s AD                 |
| Dead Sea Scrolls | Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek | 100s BC - 100 AD | 100s BC - 100 AD        |

> Presumably, the older the text is, the closer to the original it is
> Jerome preferred original Hebrew to the Septuagint



> If you've heard people talk about the "Hebrew Bible", if they're talking about
the Old Testament, they're terribly misguided



### Modern Methods of study
See handout

> "Other ancient authorities" in a bible means other manuscripts

> authoritative means "approved for use in the liturgy"; not necessarily that it
> is the best version

#### textual criticism 
#### "higher" criticisms
Emerges in the 18th century; also called historical criticism

#### synchronic approaches

### Catholic/"pneumatic" commitments
Attentiveness in the Spirit
