### Peter and Petrine Communities
#### Rome
Very early he is associated with Rome
Certainly spent time in Jerusalem, and some time in Antioch

Earliest post-biblical sources and [[Acts]] put Peter with Rome

The Ascension of Isaiah
- apocryphal and allegorical, about crises in the church
- but puts Peter in Rome

No surviving counter-claims to him not being in Rome

> Modern St. Peters is built on the original basilica from 320's, which was built on a hill
> Constantine pushed the Vatican hill on top of the circus at the bottom of the hill
> built to be on top of the cult site for Peter

#### Mission
#### Tomb
There is a altar on an altar on an altar on a box behind a statue with a box with Peter in the box
Peter's disciples hacked off his hands and feet when stealing his body?? Thump thump thump

### John and Johannine Communities

The last books integrated into the scriptures

> John is more allegorically driven than the other buckets of literature in the new testament *pulls a stogie*

John is rich in images for Christ; crucial for the cultivation of early Christian doctrine

Uses generic vocabulary to do bizarre things

Even before the Gospel of John, Philo talks about Logos as a way to articulate the divine essence

Baptism has both salvific and incorporative functions
Same in [[John 6 |Bread of Life Discourse]] 

### Post-apostolic age
major devlopments:
- Christian thinking through engagement with Jewish theological ideas, hellenistic philospophy and gnostiscism
- Christian practice
    - episcopate
    - liturgy
    - "importance of catholicity" and its matainence trhough apolstolic succession

#### roman conflict
Christian claims to absolute truth conflicted with principles of Roman cultic Life
- in the same way that Judaism did XXX link this
- not viewed as a private or insignificant issue

Christians were viewed as ememies of
culture
politics
Jews

Began to be viewed as apostates, not just as "weird Jews"

Exceptionally rare for Romans to persecute on the basis of what they thought
- usually pretty tolerant with weird ideas
- so, Christians were persecuted for civil problems
    - distrubing public order

Persecution most often happened after civil disturbances
The most common accusation was treason or sedition
- Christians refusing to publicly participating in cultic practices and rites

64 AD persecution:
- Fire in Rome blamed on the Christians
- Deaths of Peter and Paul
- Claudius had expelled the Jews from Rome over internal Jewish conflict
- Nero deflects criticism by blaming the Christians
- If you've got enough people to hold multiple days of bloody circuses and there are some left over to torture, then there must have been tons of Christians in Rome by 64

After the death of Nero, "damnation of his death"
- many things about Nero and what he did was erased, with exceptions
- notably what survived was a prescription of the name "Christian"
    - Illegal to self-identify as a Christian by the middle of the first century

Little evidence on Domitian's persecution
- but probably triggered by refusal to participate in the imperial cult
- from Domitian perspective, it is a strike at public order

### Courts and Trials

#### Pliny
- Governor of Bethinia, wrote to Trajan
- Writing about a leftover law from Nero
- "is the name Christian enough to kill them, or ust other crimes be shown?"
- "the first 'don't ask don't tell policy" -- don't ask if they're a Christian, and don't tell if you're a Christian
-  don't make it a big deal, but if they want to, we will accommodate them
- only two names as martyrs from this period
    - Simion of Jerusalem 
    - Ignatius of Antioch


#### Justin
Reign of Hadrian
- moderate approach to Christianity
- had to do other crimes before punishment, but if you were a Christian you'd get a worse punishment
