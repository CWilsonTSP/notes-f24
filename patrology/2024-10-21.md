### Discipline and Church
#### Pelagius (354-420/440)
Morality and Faith
- Wanted to address lukewarmness? 
- Thinking about the obligations Christians have to live holy lives
- hesitation of his teaching came from laity
- Augustine addresses him
- 418 zozamus agrees with north african bishops and condemns Pelagius' teachings

## From Nicaea to Chalcedon
### Missionary Activity
#### Inside the Empire
Institutions from institutions

Almost exclusively an urban phenomenon until the 5th century, because cities had
people

Theodosius (380) began closing some Roman temples and began some restrictions on
public Roman worship. HE made Christianity the cult of the Empire, not
Constantine 

#### Outside the Empire
Questions of barbarians

Conversion and inculturation happened simultaneously

### Imperial Institutions
#### Local Episcopal Churches
Involved with local celebrations and culture

Production of secondary subordinate bishops

#### Metropolitan Relationships
First developed in the East

seems to have been conceptualized in Egypt 

"Greater" churches overseeing other churches popularized (EG. Rome and
Alexandria are seen as having greater responsibility)

New bishops are to be ordained by all other local bishops

4th cen. Boundaries being conceptualized as coinciding with those of civil
administration -- EG. richmond goes through basically all of virginia, even
though it makes more sense for the eastern shore to be part of Wilmington and
bristol to be Tennessee 


#### Promotion/Prevalence 

### Roman Primacy
#### Transformed Prestige


#### Self-justifying ideology

#### Lack of competition
Peter is the only one with undisputed apostolic origin
