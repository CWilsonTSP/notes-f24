Some major persecutions
- Septimus Severus
    - beginning of 3rd Century
    - "not too bad, as far as roman emperors go"
    - Christians held influential government positions as Christians
    - But then started persecuting converts later in his reign
        - "mission grinds to a halt, shockingly"
- Decius
    - middle of 3rd centurt
    - immediately started empire-wide persecution
    - all levels of society at all areas of the world
        - this tells us that Christians were found in all levels of society at
        all areas of the world
    - these are what we think about when we think about roman persecution
    - subsided rapidly, sometimes at the behest of influential Christians
- Valerian/Gallieius
    - targeted but short
    - almost exclusively at clergy
        - but we tend to remember this more because leadership was targeted
