# discussion on Gregory the Great

## 2024-10-31

> HAPPY REFORMATION DAY!

#### Notes
"excellent psychologist"

note on translator -- difference in greek vs roman perspective 

He is writing abstractions from his own experience of people he knows, so his
experience is able to be transferred easily onto many many experiences

arranges people in groups of opposite extremes

when evaluation people, they are identified by chief vices and virtues

When he is talking about contemplation 5.2, he means having a sufficiently
robust and nourishing prayer life
