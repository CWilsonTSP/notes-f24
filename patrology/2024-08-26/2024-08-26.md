# Spread of Christianity
## Greco-Roman World
### Ancient Cultic Practices
Religion -- cultic and worship practices

*religio* -- confined to worship practices; designated as a duty of justice in
Thomas

Modern political nation-states...?
- organized principle for community
- a way of making sense that dying for the state makes sense instead of for
Jesus?
- imposed a private sphere to worship practices that separate public and private
life
- especially in the enlightenment

1st century ad -- rising criticism for polytheistic origins of the world
- stoics asking questions about cultic practices
- syncratism of oriental cultic practices into Greco-Roman activities
- "hellenistc homogeneity"
    - "mcdonaldsization" of Greco-Roman life

#### emperor's cult
- Augustus
- 1st century reorganization of cult
- when you dont have buy-in to public cultic practices, 
- "If I were to put a gun to your head you're going to go down the doctrinal or
sociological route"
- turbocharging public engagement in the 1st century
- incorporates some aspects of oriental cults
- since Rome had no monarch, it originally involved offerings to the
"personification of Rome"
    - Swearing to the genius of the emperor, not to the emperor himself

#### Eastern Mystery Cults
Appeal - ritual explanations for the purpose of human life and salvific activity

From Egypt to Iran 
- Isis and Osiris 
- Mythraism

Popular practices
- laws
- astrology
- demonology

### Paul and his work

- Paul is at the forefront of a realignment of ecclesiastical attention
- "leader in confrontation" both in an around Jerusalem and the Mediterranean
- Peculiarly (providentially?) ready to manage this
    - Jewish
    - diaspora
    - born in Tarsus (asia minor, not Semitic environment)
    - Roman citizen (speak Greek, knows Aramaic, freedom of travel)
    - Pharisee (conservative Jew)
- conversion on the road to Damascus
- first worked on Syrian Antioch
    - realizes Jews of the diaspora are most fertile ground for conversion
- most success early on is among the God-fearing pagans/Hellenists
    - Galatians 2
- Then worked among the wealthy trading cities, people who traveled
- In fairness, the letters we have in scripture are not his most crowning
achievements; its where the failures were
- Testament to his success is the persistence of the churches into the
post-apostolic age-- comically the Corinthians are still a dumpster fire for
Clement
