# Jewish Christianity, the Semitic Origins of the Church

Christianity did not come from nothing; it has a historical context from which
it came


#### Judaism in the Time of Jesus
Political ideas
- "Messiah" idea
    - political and social environment prompted the longing for the Savior as a
    political or national figure
    - After all, the 'fundamental idea of Roman government' is "we don't have
    kings"
        - Federate of rulers
- Herod the Great (73-4 BC)
    - petitioned the senate to be king of the Jews ?
    - Romans nab Jerusalem in 37 BC
- The administration  of Palestine
    - Procurator in Caesarea, part of Syria
    - Rome recognized the Sanhedrin as having legal competency for Jewish
    affairs

#### Palestinian Jewry
- "reasonable to very-firm commitment to monotheism"
- covenant
    - there is a particular relationship with God that is not extended to or
    available to others
- Messiah
    - there will be political consequences
        - freedom
        - autonomy
        - success
- law (Romans love law)
    - laws that are not binding on others
    - but also not open to others
    - nearly entirely comprehensive 

Two big groups:
- Pharisees
- Sadducees

| Pharisees | Sadducees |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| temple | law |
| interpretations of the Torah | Torah alone |
| middle class | upper class |
| resurrection of the dead | no resurrection |
| belief in afterlife | no afterlife |
| rejected the Jewish leaders | supported Jewish leaders |
 
others include
- Hasideans
    - hass-id-dee-ins
    - think about Judaism through the law, but are not detail oriented like the
    Pharisees
    - law is an expression of God's will
- Essenes
    - Ess-ains
    - the "to hell with you" Jews -- left Jerusalem and the Romans
    - fidelity to the law, with particular interest in ritual purity
    - "proto-amish"
- Zealots
    - "mostly-peaceful protesters" of the ancient world

#### Jewish Diaspora
More important for our consideration might be the Jews of the Diaspora

Historically important for the spread of Christianity

Far more Jews outside of Israel than inside

Major Cities outside of Israel:
- Alexandria
- Rome
- Antioch

Primarily worked in Greek as the primary language
- Importantly connected to the development of the Septuagint 

Propaganda talking points
- Antiquity of mosaic law
    - The coolest thing is the oldest thing
- philosophical attractiveness of monotheism

#### Jesus of Nazareth and the Church

Three main sources (BUCKETS!) -- not modern biographies per say, but we can know
something from what is presented
- synoptic gospels
- Johannine Corpus
    - Gospel of John
    - Letters of John
    - Revelation
- Pauline Letters
    - Cleaning up problems
    - pumping up converts

Those called to Christianity formed a new community
- called the Church
- duties
    - teaching
    - judgment
    - priest
    - mission

#### The Church's beginning
Difficult to see
- there isn't a lot to go on, and what there is is intensely selective
- Paul isn't trying to make a comprehensive picture of what exists or what is
good
    - rather he points out problems and finds solutions
    - looking at just Paul's letters makes Christianity look like one big
    dumpster fire that would never work
        - premise of "A World full of Gods"

We can see however that the early Christians were firm in faith and had a
commitment to firmness in the faith and correction towards firmness

Building institutions was imperative; things, not people, that manage things
over time
- early witness to apostolic succession by replacing Judas the Betrayer
with Barnabas (?)
- appointing 7 deacons as witnesses 
- meetings to talk about stuff (Acts 15)

Persecution comes with this development
- Christians/Jews
- Christians/Romans
- Jews/Romans

Pauline expansion focuses on the Jews of the Diaspora and acts as an entry
point to the Greco-Roman world.

#### Beginning Impressions
Clear early Christian interests:
Organization, belief, and piety
- Hierarchical society
    - Preferred Apostles
    - Apostles
    - deacons
        - who are not apostles
    - elders
        - who are not deacons
- Jesus is the Messiah
- Liturgical activity
    - Baptism
        - membership in community
        - forgiveness of sins
    - Eucharist
    - anointing, particularly in care for the sick
