## Culture Chance and  The Final "Victory" of the Church

### Intellectual struggle of the Pagans

#### Emperor Gallienus 
r. 260-268
"a nice guy as far as roman Emperors go"
Christianity not legal and not tolerated, but the atmosphere was "very good"

#### Porphyry 
(232-305)
Neo-Platonist
Pupil of Platinus (sp?)

*15 Books Against the Christians* 
- Behavior of Biblical figures, including Jesus and Paul
- Criticizes Christian philosophical sophistication
- analyzes cultic practices as un-Roman or nonsensical 

> Diocletian:
> As far as roman government is concerned, Diocletian recognized that a polity
> responsible for governing a large area of land is hard-- big, harrrd
> Reorganized roman government into the tetrarchy, into 2 parts, east/west,
> Greek/Latin
> Decided that 2 successors was not enough, so subdivided both parts into 2, so
> there were senior emperors and junior emperors in each
> also a purge of Christians from the Roman army
> 

#### Edict of Toleration
311
Emperor Galerius (305-311)
Key turning point

Stopped Roman persecution of Christian cultic practices across the empire;
officially rescinding of Nero's policy

#### Conversion of Constantine
Maximinus Dia: rolled back edict of Toleration

Upon Galerius' death, tetrarchy basically dissolved 

General in Britain 

DEFINITIVE turning point

Background:
- cult of summus deus: 'highest god'

Battle of Milvian Bridge, 312
- crux vision

Edict of Milan, 313
- restorative edict
- restores properties, honors, and wealth

Donatist Controversy
- north Africa
- appoints bishops to investigate and recommend action
- this shows Constantine's interest in intra-christian affairs


#### Constitution of the Church
into the open
- assess and allow development
- since Christianity is legal, it allows people to recognize and sort the weird
but acceptable from the weird and totally not allowed

Change from a church of martyrs to a church of imperial prestige? Moral rigor
and cultural integrity are easier to maintain in isolation and under duress than
not

Clergy
- bishops, presbyters, deacons are clearly present
- bishop has unquestioned plenary power
- deacons seem to be more talked about than presbyters and have important pastor
work: care for the poor, administrative oversight. Not a lot of discussion of
sacramental activity. 
> Female deacons-- if deacons aren't sacramental ministers, then *what does it
matter?* 

- we can see references to the minor orders

Church Organization
- daughter communities are bound to mother communities by mission
- formation of ecclesiastical providences governed by regional synods
> SCREEEEE SYNODAL WAYYYYYY
- Metropolitan bishops in addition to region
- Diocese is a roman structure

Roman Church
- important, very important 

Ecclesiological reflection
