### Syllabus day

#### Pre-emptive warnings

- very very dry (chokingly dry) sense of humor
- Thinking is hard (agreed)
    - Thinking is like baseball
        - not all of your ideas are good. Not even most of your ideas
        - if 3/10 of your ideas are worthwhile, that is really good
        - your "batting-average" for good ideas is much lower than you think
- writing is even harder (yeah...)
- watch parliament on BBC

#### Fun rumors
- "Liberal?"
    - where you are looking from matters as much as what you're looking at
- "Anti-Papal?" 
    - Having a sense of how things have changed allows us to think about how
    what happens now

"I'm certainly not crazy into modernity"
"Modern canon law reads like journalism to me"
