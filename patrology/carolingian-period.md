## 2024-11-18

### Building an Empire
![[Pasted image 20241118095616.png]]
#### Italy
Lombard Kingdom
- Charlemagne attacks the Lombards at the request of the pope

774 - pilgrimage to Rome
- Charlemagne gets roman titles 
- after 774, papal documents and N. European docs. keep track of dates by pope name, rather than emperor names.

#### Saxony 
Something about Willoford

> Is tithing one of the actions on your RCIA program?

Conversion by force

How useful are threats and intimidations on converts to the faith?

x was advocating for impulsion on Christians, not non-Christians

Monasteries became the 'outposts' for evangelization efforts.
> [!book] Heliand
> Interpretive poetic gospel for the german people -> Jesus and his warband.
> (Is this the new evangelization?)
> ðŸ˜†

#### Spain
Muslims and catastrophe 

Muslims controlled the Iberian peninsula for several centuries

There was internal division between different ruling figures

When other Muslim rulers heard about the seat of Barcelona, they gathered together to raid and Charlemagne said NOPE and left
> [!further]
> Remembered in the Song of Roland; his key generals ad important figures get ambushed and WHACKED

#### Bavaria
Christian problem
- Since the time of Boniface, Bavaria had Christians and bishops and ecclesial structure.
- This made it a problem for Charlemagne to go in there and just invade

### Renewal of Church and Empire
#### Change of Political discourse
 Is Charlemagne is interested in ensuring right worship as a Christian King?
 - Conquest involves a spread of Christianity with an reflection on Old Testament conquest

They write about themselves as a "New Israel", rather than a "new Rome", the inheritors of God's law and the establishers of the Law on the Earth.
- Charlemagne as a new David rather than a new Caesar, 

> [!aside] Foundations of Trust
> What are foundations of trust today? What makes you think other people aren't going to eat you?
> In the middle ages, a foundation was Christianity

#### "*Pax et Concordia*"

#### Ecclesiastical Reform
Metropolitan structure

Accent on faith and morals

Carolingians bring back (pandexs? XXX) 
- Tours Bibles
- Theodulf Bibles

Benedictine monasticism became to be seen as a good form; western monks are benedictine, but what kind of benedictine are you?

> [!question]+ Did Charlemagne try to imitate David by having concubines?
> lmao ok

### Theological Controversies of the Carolingian Era
#### Iconoclasm
Poor translation of II Nicaea into West
- Darn westerners couldn't read Greek (couldn't be me)
- "Adoration" vs "veneration"
- argue against Nicaea's universal juristiction?
	- Eastern -- should be considered ecumenical
	- Western -- ecumenical if totality of churches are there and the answers lie within the tradition. And also if the emperor likes it. 


#### Adoptionism
Elipandus of Toledo (d. 808)
- uses expressions from the Visagoth liturgy, "Christ adopted in his humanity and not adopted in his divinity"
	- Tries to guard against Docetism 

Issue of theological meaning of "adoption"
- Does adoption mean authentic or natural born sonship (Roman) or a kind of brotherly conjunction (gothic)?

#### Filioque
Expression in the Nicaean Creed that was shockingly innovative to the Greeks

First appears in the Visagoth world after III Toledo as a clarification against Aryanism

Greeks initially take issue with those damn Latins adding things to the creed on their own authority without a council 

### Frankish Kingdom to Christian Empire
#### Schools and Missions
Part of the program of the Carolingian renewal was establishing monasteries and universities 
- Literacy is useful lmao 

> [!dict] Oblation
> Dropping Steve off at the Monastery

#### Troubles of Pope Leo (d. 816)
Popes can have controversy. Not that we would know, our popes have been perfect for the last 60 years

Leo had trouble, so much so that they wanted to try to jeopardize his pontificate. We don't really know what his trouble was though.

Charlemagne sent people to investigate, and they issued a strong pro-Leo report 

> [!dict] Nimbus
> The halo cloud thing around heads in images
> A square nimbus indicates that the person was still living during composition

#### Christmas, 800
Pope crowns Charlemagne with a short blessing 

When he went back to Ockan he crowned himself lmao 

### Carolingian Political Theory
#### Law Codes
Civil and Ecclesiastical 
- Supposed to be consistent to push peace and order

#### Internal Ecclesiastical
Push Benedictine monasticism
- Benedict of Aniane (d. 821)

#### External Ecclesiastical
Pursue peace with Eastern Roman Empire

# The Fracturing of the Carolingian Europe
## The Dissolution of Christendom

### Strains on Christendom
#### Fracturing of the Franking World
Louis the Pious (d. 840)
- Beginning of the end of unity
- His sons didn't get along and did a lot of wars

Lothar marries his sister, sooooo-- Consanguinity laws and requirements -- LETS GOOOO
- Messy fights over this and divorce and marriage and annulment 

#### Continued pressure from the Mediterranean
- Northern Spain, Crete, Italy
	- Probing Muslim powers

Muslims and Vikings are making problems

Hungarians also show up from the east and make problems

#### New Foes from the North
- Carolingian contacts with Mercia
