> We're all part of GOd's massive conspiracy" -- Phelan

Social cohesion issue that the Christian are not swearing the same
*sacramentum* as the other Romans
> Cold war pledge of allegiance analogy -- you had to make the public
> declaration, UNLESS YOU'RE A COMMIE

#### Christianity and Judaism
Identity of Christ and Mosaic Law 
- Apostles dealt with both

Examples
- Kerinthos 
    - Late 1st century, early 2nd
    - Asia Minor
    - Reason John wrote Gospel (Iraneus), to combat their poor Christological ideas:
        - Jesus was the natural son of Mary and Joseph
        - The Son descended upon Jesus in the form of a dove at Jesus' baptism,
        and then became the Christ
        - The Son left Jesus before he died, and returned to Jesus when he rose
        > "Divine puppet theory" lmao

- Ebionites
    - Dualist Christians
        - Jesus consecrated by God as the Messiah
        - Jesus just a prophetic dude to tell them what the law should mean
    - Proponents of reforming the Mosaic Law
    - concerned about Pharisaic interpretation of the Law
    - Anti-Pauline

### Post-Apostolic Fathers
#### Sources for early church history

Clement
- Learned in Jewish and Hellenistic Thought
- Seems to manipulate stoic philosophy well
- Leader of Church in Rome, reaches out to dived church in Corinth
- Wrote letters to churches he passed through on his way to rome after his
arrest

Polycarp
- Asia Minor
- seems to have had contact with apostle John
- *Passio* of Polycarp
    - Meditation of the Eucharistic Sacrifice?

Didache
- Syria
- guide for community organization
- influenced by Jewish Thought
- sets dramatic social expectations
- "rule of life"

Barnabas
- (Spurius?)
- Associated with Paul's companion
- Jewish thinker, critical of late 1st century Judaism
- "Crankier than he is learned"

Shepherd of Hermus
- According to fragments, connected as a relative of Pope Pius
- "simple believer" concerned about the Jewish background of Christianity
- interested in moral reform and the moral life

Connecting themes
- centrality of prayer
    - forms of prayer in line with OT traditions, plus new ideas
        - EX redemption
    - beginnings of liturgical traditions
        - liturgical prayer more connected to the Father
        - private prayer more connected to the Son
- Sacraments
    - Baptism
        - Trinitarian formula essential
        - saving power
        - "seal of baptism"
            - "don't break the seal!"
    - Eucharist
        - featured in some writings
        - creates and sustains the unity of the Church
            - so must be appreciated and celebrated
- Christocentricity
    - repentence is important because salvation is jeopardized by moral
    imperfection

#### Ecclesiology and Organization
Local Churches 
- joined together as congregations
- Schism and heresy are routinely presented as enemies
- "Dositism" a problem in the east
- mentions Elders, deacons, priests
- clearly should be a single bishop of each community
    - but what this means is unclear

Apostolic Succession
- promoted early on
- implied by Clement to the Corinthians
    - but does not order or require, simply advising
    - but is included in some early copies of scripture
- implied by Ignatius to the Romans

Universal Church
- Schism and heresy are routinely presented as enemies

## Church in the Second Century
#### Roman Scrutiny of the Church
Persecution 
- Marcus Aurelius and Commodus
    - Saw Christians in a Stoic category
    - despised Christians
        > "A bunch of dangerous idiots"
    - 177 -- "mostly peaceful protest" roused against the Christians
        - Prompted on atheism and immorality of the cult
            - Atheism being not participating in the Roman cult
    - Persecutions under provincial governors' direction

Literary Polemic
- Intellectual analysis of Christianity
- Trigger for apologetic work in the second century
    - Justin Martyr
- Celsus (d. 180)
    - regarded by Christians as the most intelligent and potent critic of
    Christianity
    - stoic
    - still circulating 1-2 generations after his death
    - we don't have a complete work of this :(
    - refuted by Origin

> I see rapid hand movements, and like a predator it draws my attention -- Phelan

#### Christian Apologetics
Tailored responses to critics
- Surviving Jewish refutations:
    - Jesus as Messiah
    - connections between Jesus and OT prophesies
- Hellenists:
    - Ethics

- "The best Romans are the Christians"

Justin Martyr (100-165)

#### Internal Disputation
Gnosticism
- not a discrete organization or distinct body of teachings
- set of principles
- manifestation of a late-classical synchronistic dualism
    - no institutional continuity
    - a kind of ontological dualism
    - synchronistic -- integrating
- maybe better seen as a hermenutic than a group
- target of many early Christian writers
    - Justin
    - Tertullian
    - Hippolytus
    - Iraneus
- Marcion (110-160)

        - dualistic ideas (god of OT and god of NT)
    - promoting disunity
- Polemic works begin to outline how Gnosticism is not in line with Christianity
    1. Apostolic tradition
        - are ideas connected to the apostles?
    2. Apostolic Succession
        - are leaders connected to the apostles?
    3. movement toward recognizing canon of scripture
