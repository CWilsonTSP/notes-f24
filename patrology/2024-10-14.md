# Faith and Discipline

- [x] ### Run up to Ephesus (459)
Christology Problems
- Apollinaris of Laodicea and Gregories

Antiochenes used word and flesh language
ALexandrians used soul and body language

Cyril gets angry, asked to promote unity among Christians?

Some weird feud between Cyril and Nestorius

Cyril starts, runs, and concludes the council of Ephesus before Nestorius or his
supporters even show up lol

Takeways -- theotokos is obligatory, and so is the council of nicea

### Run up to Chalcedon (451)

Reconcilliation of antioch and ALexandria

Rise of monophysitism

Abbot Eutyches -- council and creed of nicea are autoritative and guiding, but
no need to go beyond these declarations

Leo's tome

#### Discipline and Empire
Pricillianism
- aesetical movement, kinda schismatic instead of heretical

Donatism
- emerged under constantine
- north african christian rigorists 
- ran churches and had hierarchy

Bishop parmenian


Augustine worked against the donatist
what the heck is going on

Rebaptism or something?

Pelagius
- morality and faith
- exiled to east
