## Unit 2


Building on the CCC
- faith is man's response to divine revelation
- faith is a human act
- but also is a gift, and a virtue

Faith and "life"
Faith is the beginning of eternal life
Aquinas -- "Faith is a habit of the mind whereby eternal life is begun in us,
enabling the intellect to assent to truths that are not apparent"

The visible sending of the Son
- seeing and believing Christ
- something something seeing Christ, matter of faith not sight
- Thomas and seeing the Risen Christ

Christ's coming and going
- incarnation and ascension 
- ontological gap between God and man
- what the fall introduces -- moral gap
- he comes to heal, yes, but also to elevate and perfect us



Trinitarian sendings
####  what is meant?
> Who knows
Christ sends the Apostle's the Holy Spirit

Trinitarian Sending == temporal expression and extension of eternal procession
whereby a divine person exists in a new way where he previously existed by
essence, power, and presence (as first cause/creator)
> because that's an intelligible sentence 

#### what is at stake?
> Who cares

Trinitarian doctrine
- in regards to visible sending
- soteriology of grace and communion
> why use big word when small word do?
