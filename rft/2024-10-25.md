#### Aquinas' definition of faith
unpacking Heb, 11:1
- "Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things
that appear not"
- It is not immediately clear how this is a good definition
- Faith is not just an act of the intellect; it includes intellectual assent, but
it is an act of the whole person with love towards that which is believed in

Reformulating:
"faith is a habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in us, making the
intellect assent to what is non-apparent."

#### Who are the faithful?
God as cause of faith
- "the faithful are constituted by God"

Two things necessary for faith:
1. "that the things which are of faith should be proposed to man"
    - this means divine revelation is necessary as a first condition
2. "the assent of the believer to the things which are proposed to him"


Seeing a miracle or being persuaded not a sufficient cause for faith, since
two people may take them differently

- External and internal
- and, of "unformed"

What of dissent?

#### The vice of Unbelief
Anyone who does not have the virtue of faith is an unbeliever
- but there are two categories here
- Unbelief due to denial (opposition)
    - This is a sin
- Unbelief due to lack of knowledge (pure negation)
    - This is not a sin
