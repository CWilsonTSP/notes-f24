SYST 501
Reading questions for 9/13
Readings: Augustine, De doctrina Christiana II.1-11; Dionysius, Celestial
          Hierarchy, chs. 1-2; Aquinas, ST I, q.1, aa.9-10

1. In the last two articles of the Summa theologiae’s opening question, Thomas
   focuses his attention on Sacred Scripture, considering how—and why—God
teaches in it the way that he does. For this inquiry Thomas relies upon the
thought of Augustine and Dionysius, citing them at certain points but also
drawing on them without making explicit reference to his sources. Within the
ninth article, how does Thomas utilize arguments or insights from the texts of
Augustine and Dionysius to explain how God’s manner of teaching by means of
figures is especially suited to the needs of, and variations in, God’s human
audience? (Please provide at least two instances of use—whether cited quotation,
cited allusion, or uncited echo—for each of the two texts.)

Aquinas cites Augustine in the following two places:
1. Responsio of article 10, to say that it would not befit an omniscient God to
   only understand one sense of a word.
2. reply to objection 1 of article 10, to say that the senses in which a word is
   used are derived from a single source, the literal sense, and so even other
   uses reflect it.

Aquinas cites Dionysius in the following two places:
1. Responsio of article 9, to say that "spiritual truths are fittingly taught
   under the likeness of material things."
2. reply to objection 2 of article 9, to say that the use of metaphor or
   imagery does not detract from revelation but rather raises them to different
   levels of human understanding. 
3. reply to objection 3 of article 9, where he summarizes Dionysius' reasons
   that revelation not only *may fittingly* use metaphor, but *should* use
   metaphor




 
2. What are the various possible “senses of scripture” mentioned by Thomas in
   the tenth and final article of Summa theologiae I, q.1 (i.e., not just in the
corpus, but in the objections and replies)? How does he group these various
senses into the four primary categories of “senses of scripture” that he here
proposes?

Thomas says there is primarily a literal sense, which itself contains other
senses that depend on it, and three spiritual senses: allegorical, moral, and
anagogical. The second objection makes use of a division for Augustine's
division of the Old Testament, to which in his reply asserts that the
historical, etiological, and analogical senses fall under the literal sense. He
also mentions a parabolic sense in objection 3, to which he replies also falls
into the literal category.
