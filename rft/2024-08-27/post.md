SYST 501
Reading questions for 8/27
Readings: 1 Cor. 15:1-11; CCC, nos. 74–141
 
1. According to the CCC, who bears responsibility for the preservation and
   faithful transmission of divine revelation from generation to generation?
(Hint: there is more than one right answer to this question; see how many you
can find.)

The "teaching office of the Church alone" has been given the task and ability to
authentically and faithfully interpret scripture. So, the Magisterium has the
responsibility. This in turn binds the faithful to accept the teaching of the
Church and to hand it down properly to their children.
 
2. Although the CCC especially associates Sacred Tradition with the oral
   preaching of the gospel by the apostles, it does not limit it to this alone.
What else does the CCC regard Sacred Tradition as including? And, what does it
say about the relationship between this fuller notion of Sacred Tradition and
the Church’s various ecclesial traditions?

Sacred tradition also includes apostolic succession, the canon of scripture,
and the magisterial interpretation of scripture, and other ecclesial traditions. 
Under the guidance of the Magisterium, the Church may change or abandon various
traditions, but can never do away with Sacred Tradition as it comes from the
Apostles and the Holy Spirit themselves.
