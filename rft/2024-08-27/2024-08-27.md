# [[operative-principles |Operative Principles]]

#### Operative principles

These are operative principles of Gods teaching -- how it is that God reaches  
and teaches Man

1. Fitting necessity of the sensible and enunciable
2. Trinitarian Christo-centricity

These principles are illustrated in [John 1 > 1](app://obsidian.md/John%201#1)-18

It is in and through this second divine person made man that is supporting [#1--](app://obsidian.md/index.html#1--)  
that man knows on the basis of senses, and so he becomes man to know him by our  
senses -- we can hear him and see him, touch him (taste him?)

Outlier in John's prologue-- what TF is John the Baptist here?

3. Instrumental mediation

- John the Baptist actually has an important part to play
- This might be weird to introduce him, because unless you're blind or stupid  
    you don't need someone to tell you there is light  
    - but maybe we are blind and stupid... that might be the point?  
    - but there is also something fundamentally good about bearing witness to  
    the light and instructing others in this way
- John the Baptist is a stand-in to all of those who bring God to the people
- How does God reach man? Through other men
    - relates back to #1
    - we come to know from other people
    - so, we are in the position of John where we also stand in for the mediator  
        that bears witness
    - In and through our ministry God wants to use us in this way
- Mediation does not necessarily imply layers of distance between us and God

### One Sacred Deposit
Sacred Scripture and Tradition belong to one, single unity

> *Dei Verbum* 

#### Dual Authorship
CCC 105: Sacred Scripture is Gods word in human words
CCC 106: Also true human authors, but they are not the first origin of the
truths
107: The inspired books teach the truth; everything should be regarded as
inspired by the Holy Spirit

The Bible is an artifact, that is made by mad, but this does not diminish that
it was inspired by God

##### XXX
1. Attentiveness to unity
2. living tradition
3. harmony of the truths

#### Distinction of senses
Important to take into account historical and cultural context of written text

CCC 115-119
1. Literal
    - signification of things with words
    - what we say
2. spiritual
    - Sanctification of things by other things
    - not by the words?
    - Providential direction
    Three spiritual senses:
    1. allegorical
        - Signs or types
    2. moral
        - not moral teachings themselves, but moral extrapolations
            - Man born blind, made to see, must change his life after his
            encounter with Christ. We can generalize this to a general moral
            principle
    3. anagogical
        - Eternal significance

#### Biblical Canon
CCC 120-133

The OT and NT are united in their testimony of Christ, even when it is
testimony to the past with no immediate connection to Christ

46 old, 27 new

All bear witness to Christ:
OT -- the one who is to come
NT -- Different temporal frame, as the Christ who has come

> "there is no inspired table of contents"
There is no inspired indication of what is inspired

The Canon, of course comes from the living Tradition of the Church
[[1 Cor 15#3]] (in accordance with the Scriptures)

### Sacred Tradition
#### What is it?
1. doctrine/teaching
    - orally taught or in writing
2. life/action/moral conduct/example
3. worship/prayer
    - liturgy

> "So much of what culture is, is unwritten"
> It is also all-encompassing-- from the size of a nation to the size of a home
> "We fundamentally participate in culture by participating in culture"

#### Relation to (t)raditions
Distinct from (T)radition

tradition encompasses so much, almost everything that is not Tradition

Tradition puts you inside the Church and helps to form its unity

Tradition is received from tradition
- there is no "the Mass" apart from a celebration of the Mass
- Human nature is instantiated in individual humans, likewise with Tradition

tradition is the essential point of interaction with Tradition
