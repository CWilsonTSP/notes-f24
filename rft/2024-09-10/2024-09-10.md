### Outline 
Theology as Science (Cont.)
- Scope and nobility

Theology as Wisdom

Consolidation of Gains

Theological Method
- Concerns about argument
- rational argumentation
- reliance on "authorities"
- hierarchy of authorities
    - in ST I q1, a8 ad 2 and elsewhere


### Theology as Science (Cont.)
It is a practical science
- Man must first be known so they can direct their minds and actions to it

But it is more properly/immediately speculative
- it is still a pursuit of God, who is knowable

Since it is both speculative and practical, it is a more noble science than
something which is either speculative or practical alone

### Theology as Wisdom
article 5 obj 1

Yes? I' not sure whats going on



### Consolidation of Gains?
[[theology#definition#rft|Full defintion of Theology]]:
Reasoned (1) study (2) about God and things in relation to God (3), on the basis
of divine revelation (4), for the purpose of coming to a greater understanding
of these things (5), and in turn, a greater love (6)

1. ST I, q. 1, a. 5, ad 2; a 8, c, ad 1, ad 2
2. ST I, q. 1, a. 6, ad 3; a 8, ad 2
3. ST I, q. 1, a. 3, ad 1; a. 4c; a. 7c
4. ST I, q. 1, a. 1, ad 2; a. 3c; a. 4c
5. ST I, q. 1, a. 4c; a. 5c
6. ST I, q. 1, a. 1c; q 43; II-II, q. 45

### Theological Method
#### "Concerns about argument"
Much of theology is a matter of argument
> it employs or proceeds by matter of argument

Are arguments from authorities inappropriate? 
- Shorthand for making a case?
- Cop out for not having an actual argument

#### rational argumentation
Three forms that for theology and Sacred Doctrine:
1. fittingness:
    - does not prove, but establishes harmony or agreement
    - "in keeping with the story"
    - "analogies are basically arguments from fittingness"
2. Theological Deduction
    - coming to a conclusions based on other truths
    - not simply a proof, but rather using truths to demonstrate? 
3. Philosophical demonstration
    - Theology can argue in proof for things of divine revelation
    - philosophy can prove truths of God (preambles of Faith?)

> How the actual hell did he get these for the reading question I don't
> understand


#### reliance on "authorities"
- obtained by revelation and examined through study
- explicit appeals 

1. Church Doctors
2. Philosophers 
3. Those to whom revelation was made
    - Human authors of scripture
    - apostles

> Again, how did he get this

- in ST I q1, a8 ad 2 and elsewhere
- See Handout, I guess
