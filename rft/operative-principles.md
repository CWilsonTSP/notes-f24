# Operative Principles

These are operative principles of Gods teaching -- how it is that God reaches
and teaches Man

## 1. Fitting Necessity of the Sensible and Enunciable
Man naturally comes to knowledge of things through the senses, especially via
seeing/sensible vision and hearing/language (CCC 170, 185).

## 2. Trinitarian Christocentricity
The triune God is fully revealed and encountered in Jesus Christ, the Incarnate
Son/Word (CCC 151, 158)

These principles are illustrated in [[John 1#1]]-18

It is in and through this second divine person made man that is supporting #1--
that man knows on the basis of senses, and so he becomes man to know him by our
senses -- we can hear him and see him, touch him (taste him?)

Outlier in John's prologue-- what TF is John the Baptist here?

## 3 Instrumental Mediation
God's ordinary way of reaching and teaching man is through other men (CCC
166-167).

- John the Baptist actually has an important part to play
- This might be weird to introduce him, because unless you're blind or stupid
you don't need someone to tell you there is light
    - but maybe we are blind and stupid... that might be the point?
    - but there is also something fundamentally good about bearing witness to
    the light and instructing others in this way
- John the Baptist is a stand-in to all of those who bring God to the people 
- How does God reach man? Through other men
    - relates back to #1
    - we come to know from other people
    - so, we are in the position of John where we also stand in for the mediator
    that bears witness 
    - In and through our ministry God wants to use us in this way
- Mediation does not necessarily imply layers of distance between us and God

## 4. Graced cooperation
Man's response to and attainment of God requires God's grace and assistance (CCC
155).

## 5. Harmony of Faith and Reason
Although distinct, faith and reason are not opposed, because they have the
same divine origin and the same focus on the truth (CCC 159)
