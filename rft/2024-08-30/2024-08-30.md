## Transmission of revelation (continued)
### Who is responsible for handing it on?
The apostles and their successors (CCC, nos. 77-78, 85-86)
- The Magisterium is the servant of the word of God

The whole Church, that is, all the faithful (CCC, nos. 84, 91-93)
- 3rd operative principle -- the primary way of God's teaching is through others
- Though all are equipped, it is not equal

The Holy Spirit (CCC, nos. 78-79, 81, 94)
- [[ 1 Cor 15 ]]

There is a special entrusting of the presbyterate, not to hold power over
others, but to make the grace of God and his very presence available to others.

    

## Faith as man's response to revelation
> Revelation elevates, and after the fall, heals that which was damaged by sin

### general import/necessity of Faith
The CCC places a great emphasis on faith

- [[ Heb 11 ]]
- [[ Heb 11#6 ]] -- without faith, it is impossible to please God
- Faith is itself the beginning of eternal life, or life in God
> Baptism? Faith of parents

- Faith makes us experience in advance a glimmer of the beatific vision.

> 4th operative principle -- graced cooperation: man's response to, and
> attainment of, God requires God's grace and assistance  

### Three Related Meanings of "Faith"
#### Deposit
- preserved and proclaimed by the church, and held and professed by the faithful
(CCC 84)
- "The Faith"
- underscores the connection between revelation and faith
- God reveals things, and we are called the believe them

#### Human Act
- involving free assent and obedience to what God has revealed (CCC 143, 150,
154-155)
- faith as a response
- "have faith"
- it is not simply taking something as true, but having a transformative
response to it
    - That is, we are called to live in accordance with this truth

> you can say the Creed but not live like a Christian


#### Capacitating Gift
- the gift which alone enables man to perform the act of believing (CCC 153,
1814)
- The theological virtue of Faith
- underscores the [[operative-principles#4. Graced cooperation |fouth principle]]

#### How are these related, and does the CCC Privilege one?
- CCC seems to privilege faith as a response. (act)
- but this is not possible without the other two.

- The last object in execution is the first object of what we seek
> This is faith
> The communion that is brought about between God and Man in the *act* b of Faith

- The end point has antecedent requirements

> "I don't like living with nasty little pagans" -- Hahn


## The Reasonability of Faith
### Three Related Meanings of "Reason"
These can be related to the meanings of faith in a comparable way

#### Human Act
- involving thought, understanding, and formation of judgments via login

#### Capacitating Divine Gift
- the power of the intellect/reason which alone enables man to perform the act
of reasoning

#### Deposit
- the aggregation of knowledge attained by the use of reason
- we might call this 'knowledge' or 'science'

### harmony of faith and reason
- Faith comes from God
- Reason comes from within

The supernatural act of faith (ie. to believe) is reasonable because belief of any sort is
reasonable when the one believed is trustworthy (and God is eminently
trustworthy) (CCC 154)

The theological virtue of faith is reasonable inasmuch as it accords with man's
natural capacities as knower and love, working to heal, perfect, and elevate
these capacities, and enabling man to attain to God as beatifying end.

The deposit of faith (ie, the divine revelation contained in Scripture and
Tradition) is reasonable, that is, in no way opposed to reason, despite being
above reason and beyond its grasp-- because its source is the same God who is
the creator of reason and the naturally knowable world, and *truth cannot
contradict truth*.
- [[operative-principles#5. Harmony of Faith and Reason|fifth principle]]


## Consolidation of gains (review of principles)
5. [[operative-principles#5. Harmony of Faith and Reason]]: CCC 159
4. [[operative-principles#4. Graced cooperation]]: CCC 155
3. [[operative-principles#3. Instrumental Mediation ]]: CCC 166-167
2. [[operative-principles#2. Trinitarian Christocentricity]]: CCC 151
1. [[operative-principles#1. Fitting Necessity of the Sensible and Enunciable]]:
   CCC 170, 185

## The faith of Mary and the Church
Mary perfectly embodies Faith when she gives her assent:
*Fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum* .

She proclaims more than she is able to explain having witnessed all that God
has done through our Lord Jesus Christ.

CCC 171 -- parallel between the maternal pondering of Mary and the Church
- in both of these respects there is a maternal agent that posses more than can
be explained but yet she goes more deeply and does all she can
