SYST 501
Reading questions for 8/30
Readings: Heb. 11; CCC, nos. 142–193
 
1. In its consideration of faith in nos. 142–193 and elsewhere, the CCC tends to
   use the term “faith” in three distinct but related ways:
    - as human act (believing), involving free assent and obedience to what God
    has revealed;
    - as divine gift (the theological virtue of faith), which alone enables
    humans to perform this act; and
    - as deposit or body of truths (the faith), which is preserved and
    proclaimed by the Church and, in turn, held and professed by the faithful.

In your judgment, does the CCC explicitly privilege any one of these meanings
above the others? Relatedly, do you think there could be an adequate treatment
of any of these three meanings of “faith” without reference to the other two
meanings? Why or why not?

It does not seem that the CCC privileges the use of any of these way when
describing faith; they all seem to be used fairly commonly. I also do not think
a *full* discussion of faith could be had without all of these definitions,
because the human act requires the divine gift which requires the deposit of
truth; to freely assent, one must be able to freely assent, and there must be
something to which they assent to.
 
2. Even as the CCC consistently maintains a distinction between “faith” and
   “reason,” it stresses that they are not opposed, and that there cannot be any
real disagreement between the two. What rationale does the CCC provide as to why
this is the case? Are there other indications in today’s reading that “faith,”
in any of its three related meanings, is not unreasonable?

The concern that faith might be unreasonable may stem from the free assent and
obedience part of the faith definitions. People would disagree on what is
*reasonable*  to assent to without the "scientific evidence". But this seems to
like like the dissenter is abusing the term reason in a way which it is not used
by the CCC. Reason seems to be more along the lines of the capability of the
human intellect to know, rather what what it can or cannot know. (in other
words, making the distinction between things as reasonable or unreasonable is
the wrong way to approach the faith/reason dynamic).
