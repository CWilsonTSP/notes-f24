> [!NOTE]
> WE"RE DONE WITH AQUINAS!!!"

Previous documents on Revelation and Scripture
- *Dei Filius* (1870), Vatican I
    - Dogmatic constitution on revelation of faith
    - addresses rationalism and fideism, both as a divorce between faith and
        reason
    - Helps to establish the union of faith and reason
    - Concludes with a consideration of this harmony
- *Providentissimus Deus* (1893), Leo XIII
    - Deals with the emergence of 'higher criticism;' the 'historical critical
        method'
    - historical critical methods address compositional circumstances of the
        inspired texts, which serves to undermine how the Church regards the
        canon
    - Also sets up the Pontifical Biblical Commission
- *Spiritus Paracletus* (1920),  Benedict XV
    - Advances and reiterates the concerns from *Providentissimus Deus*, since
        Biblical scholars continue to advance their claims
- *Divino Afflante Spiritu* (1943), Pius XII
    - Recognition of a new era in Biblical scholarship 
    - Reiterates *Providentissimus Deus* and *Spiritus Paracletus*, but with a
        more considerable openness to the positive dimensions of modern
        scholarship
    - Not a 'thumbs up' to previous issues, but had been taken that way
- *Dei Verbum* (1965), Vatican II
    - Not directing itself to any concerns of modern Biblical scholarship
    - Does not address those concerns explicitly 
    - Scope is limited to what it is that the Church has always confessed
        concerning revelation, especially in Sacred Scripture
        - A more simple and more pointed articulation of what the Church
          believes
- *Verbum Domini* (2010), Benedict XVI

##### Preface and chapter 1: revelation itself
The purpose of writing this document is in keeping with the purpose in
revelation itself: "so that by hearing the message of salvation the whole world
may believe, by believing it may hope, and by hoping it may love."

The Truth is revealed for the sake of salvation, not as a merely intellectual
exercise. Faith is an assent to truth accompanied by a loving adherence to the
will of God.

It also highlights the Trinitarian Christocentricity of which we have
considered form the outset of this course; that Christ and salvation is the
focus of revelation, through the will of the Father and grace of the Spirit.

##### Light from Aquinas
Aquinas is echoed throughout especially chapter 1
