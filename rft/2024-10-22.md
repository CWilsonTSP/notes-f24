### The "same faith" of the Old and New

#### Unity and distinction of Old and New
Certain areas in which unity must be made, and others where distinction must be
made

Unity: 
- of end: beatifying union with God
- There is one God in both the old and new Testaments
- of virtue: and underlying gift of grace

Distinction:
- distance/proximity to the end
- state, relative to the incarnation
    - The old law applies like common law does to children -- there is a certain
    proximity to the end which is not able to be realized until later
    - They have the unity in potency, but it requires further actualization

#### Whether articles increase
Aquinas' response
- a yes and no of particular nonsensical menagerie 

#### Belief in mystery of Christ
Distinction re: states

inc == incarnation, E == explicit, I == Implicit, X == not addressed 

|  | Before sin (Adam) | After Sin (learned) | (simple) | Time of NT (Learned)| (simple) | gentiles (rev) | (no rev) |
| -- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | - | - | - | - |
| providence     | E | E | E | E | E | E | E |
| inc. re: glory | E | E | E | E | E | E | I |
| inc. re: Salv. | X | E | E | E | E | E | I | 
| Pas. & Res     | X | E | I | E | E | E | I | 
| minutes        | X | X | X | E | I | X | X |
| (Existence)        | E | E | E | E | E | E | E |
| (Trinity)        | E | E | I | E | E | E | I |


and among persons

What about "gentiles"?
