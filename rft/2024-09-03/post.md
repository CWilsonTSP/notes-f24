1. In the “Introduction” to his Westminster Handbook on Thomas Aquinas, Wawrykow
   places special emphasis on St. Thomas Aquinas’s training and responsibilities
as a medieval scholastic theologian. What does Wawrykow identify as the
threefold set of tasks that Thomas would have had as a scholastic theologian?
Does Wawrykow think that all of Thomas’s writings are to be attributed to the
fulfillment of these tasks, or do some of them reflect more personal interests?

Wawrykow identifies lecturing, disputing, and preaching as the three tasks. He
does think that at least his professional works are ascribed to this task, but
for him this does not include the Summa Theologiae or the Summa Contra Gentiles.
Wawrykow suggests that these works came from his personal interest, but I think
these works are also a fulfillment of these tasks due to the structure of the
works. 

 
2. Much of St. Thomas’s attention in these opening chapters of the Summa contra
   Gentiles is on distinguishing and relating two sorts of truth about God—one
that is naturally knowable by the light of human reason (called elsewhere the
“preambles of faith”), and another that lies beyond reason’s ken and must
therefore be divinely revealed (the “articles of faith”). As he makes clear, not
only are these two sorts of truth not opposed, but in fact both can be found
within scripture. What three reasons does Thomas offer in explaining why even
those truths about God that are naturally knowable by reason (i.e., the
“preambles”) are proposed in scripture for belief?

Thomas proposes these three reasons:
1. Few men would come to possess knowledge of God, for they may be unfit for
   such a task.
2. Even those fit for the task would only complete it in a great length of time.
3. Due to the human condition, even what can be known by reason would still be
   subject to doubt, even from the wise.
