> "You might stoke out, if God shows himself a little too much" -- Hahn

### Theology as "Wisdom"
When people use wisdom astutely , they use it in reference to the order of
something
> A wise doctor/chemist/teacher

"That which is absolutely wise is going to be the one who directs himself to the
end of the universe, which is also the origin of the universe"

> can also call the ScG the Book of the Truth of the Catholic Faith

> Absolute wisdom is truth about God


### Twofold mode of truth
Truth is revealed in these two ways:
#### [[topics/articles-of-faith|Articles of Faith]]: 
#### [[topics/preambles-of-faith|Preambles of Faith]]

#### Reasons Truth is revealed in this way
1. You'd have to be really smart
    > You need to heave leisure and be smart and wealthy lmao
2. It'd take a lot of time
    > And you'd probably die before you get it done
3. There is still a lack of certainty about these truths
    > because man is STUPID 

So, it is fitting that God reveals truth in this way.

> These are not opposed because they have the same origin

> Also they are both revealed in Scripture

### Faith and Reason
What Thomas teaches reflects what is taught in the CCC
