# Introduction and Universal Call to Holiness 

#### I. Difficulty of maintaining the connection between religion and morality
> For pagans, morality came from laws, not religion

1. In Christianity, holiness and morality are coextensive
    > virtue is a synonym here

#### II. Universal Call to Holiness
1. > [!quote] *Lumen Gentium*, 11
    > All the Faithful, whether their condition or state, are called by the Lord, each in his own way, to that perfect holiness whereby the Father Himself is perfect.

2. > [!quote] Leon Bloy
    > Life holds only one tragedy: not to have been a saint.
    1. Becoming a saint must be an explicit goal
3. Impacting the Church is becoming a Saint

#### III. The Lure of Mediocrity
1. "Being in the world"
    1. Salt and light -- the **only** reason to be in the world is to sanctify
       the world, and to show others what it means to live outside the world.
       1. If you're not a saint,  you're missing the point

    > [!quote] The Intellectual Life
    > The only really powerful and really compelling force is strong conviction joined to a character which offers guarantees to poor humanity. 


2. Good enough to make it
    1. "As long as I'm the last one into purgatory"
        1. How do you know you're good enough?
            1. The parable of the Virgins
        2. This implies a "hostile model of relativity" XXX
            1. "How can I be the worst Christian I can be and still get away
            with it?"
    2. Moral implications of purgatory
        > [!quote] Fulton Sheen
        > God hates peace in those he has destined for war
        - 1 Cor 3:11
        - Spray wood with gold spray paint
        1. pain of sense -- "detox pain"
        2. pain of loss -- pain of missed opportunities
            - schindlers list

3. "Being a good person"
    1. Have you ever actually tried being a good person?
        1. a **really** good person; cannot be a mediocre person by definition
        2. You will soon find you need help
    2. Can you be happy alone/separated from God?
        1. "Being a cosmic orphan is no way to go through life"

#### IV. Morality and Sacraments
> [!objection] Jesus teaches love, but the Church teaches the sacraments

- Faith -- Baptism
- Hope -- Anointing of the Sick
- Charity -- Eucharist
- Prudence -- Holy Orders
- Justice -- Reconciliation
- Fortitude -- Confirmation
- Temperance -- Marriage

> [!tldr]
> If you are pursing the sacraments without the virtues, you're missing the point. If you pursue virtue without the sacraments, good luck.
