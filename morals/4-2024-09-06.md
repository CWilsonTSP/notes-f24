### Saint Paul
#### I. The Failure of the World
1. Sacred History and Secular History
    1. Sacred History: Monotheism and moral law
        1. Jews: Priestly class
            1. Under the Maccabees, "the best fails"
                > "They were working really hard to get it right, but ruined it all"
    2. Secular History: Wisdom
        1. Greeks: individual learned excellence 
            1. Possession 
        2. Romans: corporate excellence
            1. Perversion
2. Christ does not need the excellences/prestige of the world to fulfill his
   mission/work
    1. He chooses people like himself as his apostles (in terms of social
       standing)
       1. Not of the Jewish priestly class
       2. Without Greek learning
       3. Without Roman class

> Augustine -- miracle: the most learned people in the world are following the
> teachings of these people

> God does not need your skill set or cultivated skills

3. [[topics/saint-paul|Saint Paul]]-- the man of the 3 civilizations 
    1. Jewish religious background, Greek learning, and Roman citizenship  
    2. Without Christ, these benefits will do you no good
        1. [[Resources/Bible/01 - RSVCE/52 - Romans/Rom-01#18|Romans 1:18ff]] -- "Look at what the pagans do with their wisdom"
        2. [[Resources/Bible/01 - RSVCE/52 - Romans/Rom-02#17|Romans 2:17ff]] -- "Look at what religious hypocrisy does
           to scandalize the world"
            > People mock the idea of faith because public Christians act so
            > shamefully

> Takeaway: None of it, neither natural nor religious excellence works without
> Christ.

> Saul to Paul: God flipped a one to a zero and everything changed

#### II. Justification in St. Paul
1. Justification == The process of being made righteous 
    1. Righteousness means being in right relationship with God
        1. [[Resources/Bible/01 - RSVCE/55 - Galatians/Gal-02#16]], [[Resources/Bible/01 - RSVCE/52 - Romans/Rom-10]], [[Rom 3]],
2. Senses of: Faith, works, law
    1. Faith
        1. [[Jas 2#14|James]]: intellectual acceptance of certain propositions
           1. Very clear -- not sufficient for salvation ([[Jas 2#17|faith without works is dead]])
        2. [[saint-paul|Paul]]: full, personal commitment to Christ
            1. [[Rom 10]] -- believe in your heart
                1. Core of the person
                2. This is sufficient for salvation
        3. [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/65 - Hebrews/Hebrews|Gospels and Hewbrews]]: confidence that results in wonders
            1. [[Luke 17#2]] -- Faith the size of a mustard seed can move mountains

        > History of heresy: a great, over correcting yo yo

    2. Works
        1. [[Gal 2#16]]: "works of the law"
            1. Mosaic dietary/ritual/civil norms
            2. Very clear -- this contributes nothing to salvation, and can
               actually be harmful to salvation
            > The rituals have a symbolic value given by God, which is 'the
            > Messiah is coming'. If you're still doing the same ones after He
            > comes, you are saying to God 'we are still waiting; the Messiah
            > has not come.'
            > 
            > Symbols were changed; these are now our Sacraments
        2. "work" that originates in God that we do and does contribute to
           salvation
           1. [[phil 2#13]] -- god is at work in you
           2. Romans 2 6, render to every man according to his works
           3. [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/53 - 1 Corinthians/1 Corinthians]] -- coworkers with God in the Vinyard
    3. Law
        1. [[Rom 3|Romans 3]]: Mosaic Code
            1. Obsolete
            2. also [[Resources/Bible/02 - DRA/55 - Galatians/Galatians]] [[Gal 2|2]], [[Gal 3|3]], [[Gal 5|5]]
        2. [[Rom 2|Romans 2]]: Written on the human heart
            1. comprises the natural law and its expression in the 10
               commandments
               > Other parts of the Pentatuch contain further specifications of
               > the natural law, but the 10 commandments comprise the basis for
               > all of them
            2. This law is still valid and binding
                1. [[Rom 3#31]] -- don't throw out the law
                2. [[Rom 7]] -- law is holy
            3. Does not provide the grace to be able to follow it 
                1. it highlights where we fail morally without helping us to not
                fail morally
                2. [[Rom 7#7]]
        3. [[Rom 3|Romans 7]]: Law of Sin in my members
            1. [[threefold-concupiscence|Concupiscence]]/proclivity to sin
                1. Makes it impossible so we can't/don't do what we know is
                   right (which causes distress!)
        4. Law of the Spirit of Life in Jesus Christ
            1. Law of Christian perfection which gives the grace to follow it
		Rom 8 -- saved by law of Jesus Christ

> Takeaway: eat all the bacon you want, reflect on moral principles, if the
> spirit of the Lord does not stop you, you'll sin every time ([[threefold-concupiscence|Concupiscence]])


#### III. Morality as Members of the Church
1. Church is a body in which what one member does affects the others
2. Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving are not just for personal purification and
   sanctification. 
    1. Praying for others in the Church 
        1. Don't let your prayer go to waste
    2. Almsgiving for the Holy Ones
        1. Don't let your money go to waste
    1. [[Col 1#24]] 
        1. Don't let your suffering go to waste

> pain exists as a motivator to avoid the perceived evil that is present

3. Head (Christ) and Soul (Holy Spirit)
    1. Our actions now involve not only the other members of the Body, but also
       Christ and the Holy Spirit
    2. When we act shamefully, not only are the other members shamed, but Christ
       and the Holy Spirit are implicated
        1. [[1 Cor 6#15]]-20
