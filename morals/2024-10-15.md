## The Fonts of Morality 
> Hey, you should know this, you goober

#### I. Sources/Fonts of Morality
> "Three tests for a good act"
1. Object -- *finis operis* ("end of the act")
    > "What is the act like?"
    1. "What" -- the intrinsic nature of an act
        > Can't be a nominalist -- you have to believe in natures
        1. The kind of act you're thinking of committing or trying to commit 
            > Not the same as the kind of act you successfully accomplish
    2. The object is NOT:
        1. The successful accomplishment of the act
            > murder and attempted murder are different, but the choice for the
            act is the same
        2. The empirical materially observable manifestations of the act
            > an acts nature includes both matter and form -- you can't look at
            > someone visually and know what they're really doing
            > Ex. Fornication and marital relations have the same external
            > appearance, but one is morally wrong
            1. Simply describing an act in physical terms does not describe it
            morally (not enough to characterize the object)
                > You can't get metaphysics out of morality, and metaphysics
                > always has moral implications
    3. If the object is bad, we call intrinsically evil/*per se malum*
        1. Always impermissible
            > If its bad by nature, its bad at all times in all places

2. End -- *finis operantis* ("end of the agent")
    > "What is the actor like?"
    1. "Why" -- motivation, state of affairs that was originally motivating the
       act
    2. A good end does not justify a bad mean/bad object
    3. A bad end/motivation can corrupt an action that has a good object
        1. If your motivations are corrupt/compromised:
            > The last temptation is the greatest treason-- to do the right
            > thing for the wrong reason. (Thomas Beckett, Murder in the
            > Cathedral)
            1. Assess your motives for what you don't have to do and maybe don't
               do it
            2. Purify the motives for what you do have to do
                1. Find your unworthy motivation, and act against it in some
                   other way
                   > If you care about praise, do something that will hurt your
                   > vanity

                   > Addiction: 
                   > Desire vs Will:
                   > One is the act of the sensible appetite, one is the act of
                   > the rational appetite

3. Circumstance -- all the other morally relevant factors involved in the
   concrete situation 
    > You *are* responsible for how people receive your actions

#### II. Importance of Passing all Three Tests
1. Watch out for strong emphasis on the test you pass
    1. "There's nothing inherently wrong with it," "the Church doesn't
       explicitly forbid it"
    2. "Is there anything wrong with wanting... "
    3. "You don't understand the situation"


> ### Dummet Article:
> #### His Argument:
> Taking the Pill -- not an intrinsically evil object
> Reducing/avoiding pregnancies -- not a bad end
> So: he suggests that it is impossible to add these together to have something
> that is always intrinsically evil?
> 
> The Church forbids the object, the act of contraception, which is the
> deliberate sterilization of the marital act
> 
> Principle of double effect vs consequentialism 
> 
> Takeaway: do not equate the physical manifestations with the object
