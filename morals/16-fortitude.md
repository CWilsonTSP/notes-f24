# Fortitude
2024-11-19
#### I. Nature of Fortitude
1. Virtue by which one does what is right, even in the midst of hardship or fear.
	- Sister virtue with temperance, by which when one refrains from what is wrong even in the midst of temptation.
2. The key fear that fortitude helps us overcome is the fear of death   
	 > [!aside] Reminder
	> The Gospel story -- when we chose to work for Satan, he became the master and he pays us in death. Christ, by dying and rising, makes us not afraid of Death.
	> Hebrews 2: Christ,  by dying, defeated him who had power over death and freed those who through fear of death had been slaves their whole lives
	1. Heb. 2 -- Fear of death makes us slaves to the Lord of Death
	2. If you're not hampered by the fear of death, Satan no longer has power over you
		1. If you are willing to give up all goods, you should be willing to give up any created good
			> [!aside]
			> Death ought not be paralyzing for Christians. If, *hypothetically* (lmao), the whole world had a fear of death and the Christian was not noticeably different, it might be an indication of the power Satan still has over the world.
			
			> [!aside] Movie Recommendations to reflect on the fear of death
			> A Hidden Life
			> Of Gods and Men

#### II. Fortitude as Opposed to Extremes
1. Extreme of cowardice
	1. Person dominated/paralyzed by the fear of loss
		> [!further] 
		> Most people might fall into this category
1. Extreme of Brashness
	1. Prompts a person to take imprudent risks
		1. To risk/sacrifice what is greater for what is lesser
			> [!aside] Miravale's Two Great Tragedies 
			> Not dying on the right hill and dying on the wrong hill.
			
			> [!example]
			> Sticking to principles where there is a greater loss for sticking to the lesser and giving up the good.
			> If a pastor is doing something really goofy and imprudent, but maybe not invalid or illicit, it could be considered brash, not courageous, to make a big deal about it.
	1. A counterfeit of courage -- based on imprudence

> [!tldr]
> If you don't die on the right hill, this is cowardice. If you insist to die on the wrong hill, this is brashness.
> Don't tell yourself that you are prudent when you're a coward, and don't tell yourself you are brave when you're imprudent.

#### III. Fortitude as Opposed to Fearlessness
1. Fortitude presupposes fear, and fear presupposes love. 
	1. Therefore, fearlessness implies lovelessness, which is not a virtue but a vice.
		> [!further]
		>  If you can give up things the Gospels requires and it does not hurt, this is a problem.
	2. Fortitude requires a love for what you sacrifice and that you are in some way averse to losing in
2. Prioritizing Goods
	1. What makes a person able to be brave, is that he values a greater good more and is willing to sacrifice a lesser good for it.
		> [!aside]
		> Miravale's good topic for confirmation talks?
		
		> [!example] Paradigmatic Examples from the Gospel
		> Treasure in a field and pearl of great price.
		> If they're wrong about what they've found, they've lost everything going after it. People think they're crazy.
		> Courage means sacrificing everything for the treasure or pearl, even if its a lot or seems crazy.
	2. Courage requires recognizing a hierarchy of objective goods.
		> [!further]
		> Going after a lesser pearl instead of the greater pearl
		1. Relativism precludes the possibility of courage.
			1. You can only sacrifice lesser for greater if you believe in lesser or greater, or know what the greater is.
			2. Relativism is enervating.
			> [!dict] Enervate
			>   To deprive of nerve, force, strength, or courage; to render feeble or impotent; to make effeminate; to impair the moral powers of. [1913 Webster]>     
#### IV. Fortitude and Risk/Investment
1. Can only be brave if you risk
	1. If there's something on the line that you stand to lose
		1. Investment
2. St. John Henry Newman on the venture of Faith
	1. What does a Christian stand to lose if the Faith turns out to be false
		> [!further] Thought experiment
		> St. Paul -- if this faith is false and Christ has not risen from the deal, we are not like everyone else. We are the most pitiable of all people.
		> Imagine: on your deathbed, suddenly it is absolutely clear that its all false. Would you think "I should have done things differently" or "I had a good run"?
		> Most people would do it pretty much the same. The indication is that they are not living their faith courageously. If you're not bigly (?) invested, you won't get a big reward.
	2. What are the key investment options? 
		1. Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving
		2. Poverty, chastity, and obedience
			> [!further]
			> - Prayer when the tabernacle could just be an empty box
			> - Fasting when you are kind of hungry.
			> - Almsgiving to a perceived corrupt financial and propaganda machine
			> - Poverty when money really seems to help yourself
			> - Chastity when the pleasure is all that is advertised
			> - Obedience when its just easier to not be or could even hurt

#### V. Two acts of Fortitude
1. Anger/righteous wrath
	1. Virtuous use of anger to eliminate some evil.
		> [!aside]
		> Overturning tables -- Moment of reform in the temple
		> The temple does not signify the Church, bur rather us. Righteous wrath is not primarily at structural reform, but rather personal reform.

		> [!example]
		> Defeating the evil in the movie for the girl
1. Endurance
	1. Clinging to/pursing some good despite some evil, despite some persistent evil.
		1. Chief test of fortitude
		> [!example]
		> Staying in the failing marriage
	2.  two facets of endurance
		1. Patience -- enduring cheerfully 
		2. Perseverance -- enduring for a long time
