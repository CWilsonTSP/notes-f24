# Old Testament Moral Concepts
2024-08-30

> How does your average westerner think of the old testament?
> Arguably the most unpleasant character in all of fiction -- Dawkins

#### I. God's establishment of a family structure
God provides these ways by which he brings people into his family.

1. Individual level -- Eden
    1. Marriage
    2. Adoption --  [[ Gen-1#26 ]]: Image and likeness
        1. [[ Gen 5#3 ]] Adam and Seth: a relationship between Father and
           Child
        > you can't really adopt a highway. To make it one of your children, you
        > would not just have to be a delusion person, but give it intellect and
        > agency and all the appetitive powers!
        2. [[ Luke 3#38 ]]: Adam and God
        3. How? [[ Gen 2#7 ]]: God's spirit/breath/life

        > sanctifying grace is a gift, and one you can lose

        > You have to be careful throwing around the phrase "child of God." Not
        > everyone is a child of God-- you have to be born again.
    3. God's Law
        1. The law is an expression of God's superior knowledge of what is good
           for us based on how we are designed.

        > Rules in the home are for the sake of the kids

        > Being a parent, it is perfectly clear why God's first commandment is
        > "don't eat that!"
        > Its a whole response to the Church's moral teaching in a nutshell --
        > don't eat the woodchips!
 
        2. Opportunity to show love and trust for God

        > What if not understanding God's Law is so that you have only one
        > chance to obey out of love and trust?
        > -- Pelelandra, CS Lewis

2. Corporate level -- Chosen people
    1. Establishment of people 
        1. [[ Exod 19 ]]: "My people"
            > First Pentecost 
        2. [[ Exod 24 ]]: Sharing one blood
        1. God and his people sharing the same blood, meaning God wants to be
           family with his people.

           > How would this work in the new covenant? God would have to become a
           > man to share a man's blood and find a way to get his blood into the
           > other body

    2. 10 Commandments -- [[ Exod 20 ]]

#### The Serpent's Re-characterization of God's Law
1. The Serpent replaces a parent/child paradigm with a master/slave paradigm -- [[ Gen 3 ]]

    > The Serpent was the first historical critical exegit  lol

    1. The Law is presented as an instrument of oppression 

    > The implication is that it is disordered when someone without the proper
    > relationship attempts to restrict your freedom
    
    2. If you accept this paradigm, the only options are to submit to
        1. Submit out of a servile fear of external punishment and a mercenary
           desire for external reward
            > so the master doesn't beat me and he gives me nice stuff

            > Islam (simply submission)

        2. Rebel in the name of human freedom and flourishing
            > one interpretation of the [[ Luke 15#11 | Prodigal Son ]]

            > Atheism

    > If you don't see God as your Father your humanity will rebel.
    > If you don't see the Church as your Mother, your humanity will rebel.

#### What happens when you break the law?
1. Pattern -- Sin, bad stuff, repentance, mercy
    > the unfortunate thing is that people don't understand that sin is what
    > starts this cycle. Too often people think it is the bad stuff.
2. Solomon
    1. [[ 2 Sam 7 ]]: God will be a Father to Solomon
    2. [[ 1 Kgs 3 ]]: God is generous to Solomon and tells him to keep his
       Commandments
    3. [[ Deut 17#16 ]]: commandment for the king; Don't multiply
        1. wives
        2. silver/gold
        3. horses
        - Why not? 1. [[ 1 John 2#16 ]]: [[threefold-concupiscence]]
            1. Concupiscence of flesh -- lust/sex
            2. Concupiscence of the eyes -- greed/stuff
            3. Concupiscence of pride -- pride/power/self

    4. [[ 1 Kgs 10 ]]; [[ 1 Kgs 11]]: Solomon's intemperance and idolatry 
        > Solomon goes absolutely flippin' nuts
        > Did Solomon offer babies to a foreign God? :(

        > What does Solomon do? Multiply women, gold, silver, and horses.

    5. [[ Eccl 1 ]], [[ Eccl 2 ]], 
        > I'm not saying Solomon wrote this. But it is presented as if.

> *A Burnt Out Case*, Grahm Greene

> We should bring back the use of the word concubine to refer to cohabitation. 


#### Takeaway: This is the Old Testament God-- who gives you Laws so that you don't end up hating your own life.
