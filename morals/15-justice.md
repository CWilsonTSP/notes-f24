# Justice and the virtue of religion
2024-11-08

#### I. Nature of Justice
1. Virtue by which we give others what we owe them.
2. Justice is a social virtue: it's always relational
	1. it is above fortitude and temperance in importance because it is more expansive: it relates to others, not just to what's happening inside you.
	2. Virtue ethics often gets the bad reputation of being about your own fulfillment, however, the most active virtue is *not* just about your own fulfillment.
	3. It preserves the good of relationship: without which the human person flounders.
	4. Injustice does more harm to the one who commits it than the one who suffers it.  This doesn't mean we don't punish the perpetrator.
	> [!example] Examples of Justice in Literature
	> > [!quote] Plato
	> > The one who commits injustice is more to be pitied than those who suffer it.
	>	
	> > [!quote] Father Brown, *Chief Mourner of Marne*
	> > You are willing to forgive when you think there is nothing to forgive, we forgive the unforgivable.  You wouldn't touch a sinner with a ten-foot pole, we touch them with a benediction.
		
3. Three others to whom we owe things:
	1. God
	2. individuals
	3. society
4. Only persons made by God are required justice.
	1. instinctively, we recognize that we don't owe things to what is less than personal
		1. when an oppressive class wants to perpetrate injustice, they use subhuman language about their victims
		2. there are no "animal rights" even though certain treatments of animals are wrong because they are bad for people.
			1. blurring the distinction between human and subhuman is *undermining* / *a direct assault on* the foundations of justice. You're setting the stage for massive injustice
				> [!quote] John Buttner
				> This seems to go in both ways, kicking your dog or putting it in a stroller.
			
				> [!paraphrase] Laudato si
				> God delights in nature, so there is a sense in which not attacking the beauty of creation wantonly is out of not destroying that which God delights in.  There are certain areas where it seems like the church seems to be applying the principle of subsidiarity to non-human situations.  esp. medicine, agriculture, and communications.
	
	1. Without recognition of God, the qualitative distinction between persons and non-persons is very hard to maintain.
		1. Atheism historically is always a prelude to widespread injustice
		2. If you don't tie it to God, you will have a lot of "slippage" between created beings with regard to what they are due.  When an atheist country turns to communism it's not long before they start slaughtering their own.

		> *quod gratis asseritur, gratis negatur*

#### II. Justice and Generosity
1. Justice and love:
	1. Justice preserves the balance between you good and my good 
		1. so that I don't violate your good in pursuit of my own
		2. The concepts of balance, equity, fairness are tied to a concept of justice: I don't gain at your loss.
	2. Love doesn't work this way: in love I make your good my good, so that in pursuing your good I am pursuing my own.
		1. this is the moral human goal.
	3. Justice presupposes that there is tension between two parties.
	4. We struggle with the parable of the vineyard because we see inequity as injustice.  Re-frame this imaginatively so that you're a guy on the first shift, and your brother is one of the workers who only worked an hour.  When it is clear that your goods are connected, you rejoice and thank the vineyard owner for his generosity.  So too with our attitudes towards others in general.
2. You are morally required to sometimes give others more than they have the right to expect from justice.
	1. because human society requires it.
		1. __This means that society won't work on the basis of strict equity.__
			> [!example]
			> Parents can't expect full repayment of everything their children have received: the world would fall apart.
			
			> [!example] 
			> Ghandi: "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind"
		
	2. because God requires it.
		1. God has been generous to us - God's generosity precedes and is the foundation for all justice.  
		2. Aquinas says (1a1ae q21 a4) the work of justice always presupposes the work of mercy.  
		3. We show justice to God by showing more than justice to our neighbor.  

		4. Every man is a debtor to his neighbor on God's account.
		5. example:
			1. A man who is considering leaving his wife might say, I don't owe it to her to put up with this!
			2. You don't but you owe it to God.
			3. The king takes it as an affront to himself when the servant to whom he has been merciful refuses to show mercy in turn.
			4. what do we owe our neighbor?  in justice to God, everything.
			5. This is why 'when we attend to the needs of those in want, we are not showing mercy, but carrying out an act of justice.'  There is a distinction between that which your neighbor has a right to expect, but not in what you are obliged to give.  You have no right to receive justice from man, but every obligation to give more than others have a right to from God.

#### III. Justice to God
1. The human person can never restore, let alone exceed, the balance of what God has given us.
	1. even if we give everything - all we have - unto our own life
	2. so every witholding from God is an act of injustice
	3. And even if martyred, you still say, "we are unprofitable servants, we have done only what we were commanded to do."
2. Virtue of religion = the supreme act of justice, i.e. justice to God
	1. The chief act of this virtue is liturgy - the mass.  this is where we come as close as possible to give God everything he has offered us.
		1. hence missing the liturgy is a grave act of injustice - missing mass on Sunday a mortal sin.
	2. SJC: if you can become perfect, and then if you offer Christ the sacrifice of the mass, you might be able to actually give back to God all that He has given you.
