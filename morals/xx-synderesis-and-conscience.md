# Synderesis and Conscience
2024-10-01

#### I. Synderesis -- First principles of Practical Reason
1. Two Faculties of the intellect:
    1. Speculative intellect
        1. First principle -- law of non-contradiction
    2. Practical intellect -- what is to be done
        1. First principle -- do good, avoid evil

2. There are also other, somewhat more specific, but still general principles
   that govern all behavior 
   > Don't eat rocks; don't be a jerk
   1. Indemonstrable -- basic and fundamental
       > You cannot prove that these are true
       > final cause and formal cause are distinct, but knowing what something is
       > can lead to know the purpose of something
        1. These are therefore fundamental, unprovable, and known

3. Synderesis -- our innate and habitual knowledge of the axioms practical
   reason
    > in practice: there is a point in which you can't just say "I didn't know"
    > Not the same as natural law; Synderesis is more general
    1. These axioms can be clarified through inference to give additional
       principles of natural law 
        > Ex. polygamy is against the natural law, but it is not innate that it is
        > wrong
        > Book: What We Can't Not Know

#### II. Conscience 
1. Conscience == the application of general moral principles to concrete
   situations
    > Synderesis tells me drunkenness is bad; conscience tells me to stop
    > drinking 

2. Conscience is an act of the intellect/reason
    > Etymology: *cum scientia*; "with knowledge"
    1. To follow your conscience == to do what is right to the best of your
       knowledge
       1. Reason must guide passion, not vice-versa; this includes compassion
           > Etymology: *cum passio*, "compassion"
           > Compassion leads to disorder if not governed by reason

           > Suffering is not an evil; suffering is the proper response to evil.
           > It is a good on both the natural and supernatural level. Pain is a
           > good response to evil which prompts you do something about it.
           > If there is evil, God has to allow suffering as a part of fixing
           > evil

    2. Conscience â‰  unaided private judgment 
        1. It incorporates all the knowledge at your disposal
            > You do not continue to rely on your flashlight when you enter a fully
            > lit house
    3. Can a person follow his conscience against the official teachings of the
       Church?
        1. If you don't accept what the Church teaches is true, then you can
           follow your conscience against the Church's teaching
           1. You just can't claim to be a faithful Catholic
               > Faithful Catholic by definition is someone who accepts what the
               > Church teaches as true
               > You can never follow your knowledge against your knowledge

3. Conscience is fallible 
    1. Your conscience is only as good as the knowledge you have --  a defect in
       the knowledge can lead to a defect in the conscience
       1. Can be mistaken in either matters of principle of matters of fact
    2. Even an erroneous conscience is morally binding -- One is always morally
       bound to follow his conscience, because 
        1. if you did not follow your conscience, you would be doing what you
           thought was evil
           > Conscience, not matter how false it is, obliges under pain of sin
    3. An erroneous conscience can be culpable , and so you can be responsible
       for the evil your malformed conscience leads you to caution
        1. Culpable ignorance happens when
            1. Repeated sin causes moral blindness 
            2. When little effort is made to find out the truth
            > You are held to the same moral standard of knowing the truth if
            > you do not seek the truth

    4. Even an invincibly ignorant conscience causes human moral damage
        > She's not responsible for it!
        > Yeah, but look at the damage she's doing!

        > They're going the wrong way down a one way street, but they don't know
        any better! Yeah, but we should tell them because its really dangerous.
        
        > "They don't know any better" does not make it okay
