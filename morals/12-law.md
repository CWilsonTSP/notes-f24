# Law
2024-10-22

#### I. Nature of Law
1. Ordinance of Reason
> be something reasonable
2. For the Common Good
> promote what is best for the people
3. Promulgated
> The people have to know
4. By a Competent Authority
> Someone has to be in charge

#### II. Human Law
1. Human Law as an implementation of natural law
    1. Must be enforceable through punishment 
    2. One should only make laws pertaining to those behaviors that can be
       complied with by the majority of citizens and are most directly linked
       to the Common Good
        1. Shouldn't legally forbid all sins or vices
            > Too far of a scope; not enforceable.
            > Also does not pertain to the Common good
            >
            > Ex. Outlawing prostitution -- if we tried to outlaw it, the world
            > would explode in lust: somewhere in ST, I-II, q. 90 and q.91
    3. Two degrees of implementation:
        1. Law of Nations -- direct expression or derivation of the natural law
        2. Civil Law (positive law) -- based on natural law, but more specific
           and drawn from prudential judgments -- so some arbitrariness 
           > arbitrariness does not, by itself, make the law unjust as long as
           > the law is rooted in the natural law
2. Must the law be obeyed?
    1. Clearly not by those who are not governed by it
    2. Do I have to obey unjust laws?
        1. Unjust because of a defect pertaining to
            > In these cases, one may break the law unless the breaking of the
            > law causes more moral harm than observing it
            1. The end -- if a law is not directed to the Common Good
            2. Author -- has to be a competent authority
            3. Form -- has to place possible and proportionate burdens on those
               it governs
               > Rosa parks bus thing
        2. Unjust because it requires something contrary to God's law
            > In these cases, one *must* break the law in order to follow God's
            > law. 
            > 
            > If people say you must follow a law unless it is unjust, You say,
            > maybe, but a law can be unjust in multiple ways. If they say a law
            > is only unjust if it commands an explicit evil, that is untrue.
        3. Even in the case of a just law, unforeseen circumstances may arise
           when the letter of the law can be permissibly broken.
           > When the bad guy in the movie planted a bomb and the good guy needs
           > to hijack a car to get to it
        4. Custom can acquire the force of law
            > Either the authority derives his authority from the people and they
            > fast track the culture to law, or the authority not derived from
            > the people is not interfering with the culture shows he is ok with
            > the culture
            > 
            > This does not mean the competent authority cannot jump in and
            > change the law
