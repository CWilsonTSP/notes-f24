# Prudence
2024-11-06

#### I. Nature of prudence
1. The virtue that perfects conscience or acts of conscience
	1. Makes us excellent at applying word principles to concrete
	   situations
	   1. Presupposes a knowledge of both
			1. General principles
			2. Concrete particulars
2. As an acquired virtue, prudence takes practice
3. Prudence, like all the cardinal virtues, lies between extremes
	1. Involves a balance -- and balance is demanding
		1. Don't use "prudence" as a synonym for comfort
	2. Prudence makes one do the right thing, which often is not the most
	   comfortable thing 
4. Has to be the first of the cardinal virtues because it is intellectual --
   it is, as a foundation, based on reason. 
	1. You cannot do the good without knowing what the good is in the first
	   place

> every mild surprise."

#### II. 3 Steps to a Prudential Act
1. Deliberation/counsel: gathering and considering the information (including
   the advice of others)
    1. Have to be really searching for the truth about what should and what
       should not be done
        > Deliberation, and considering advice, is not constantly searching for
        > what you want to hear

		> [!example]
		> Last king of Israel

	2. Failure to deliberate -- Rashness
		1. Acting impulsively

2. Judgement: deciding on a course of act
	1. Entails sifting the relevant vs. irrelevant information 
		> [!example]
        > On a  highway in a car, thinking to yourself "that guy needs to drive
        > better!"
		> Sure, maybe. But that is irrelevant to how you decided to proceed.
		
	2.  2 sub-virtues
		1. Synesis -- ability to judge well about familiar/typical situations
		> [!example]
        > You might be a good basketball coach and asked to coach the swim team;
        > you have no idea what you're doing. You have a specific area of
        > competence. 
		
		2. Gnome -- Ability to judge well about non-typical situations
	3. Failure to judge == indecision
		1. Where you can't get past deliberation

3. Execution/Command -- putting the decision into action and seeing it through
    1. You don't have the virtue of prudence unless you put it into action
    2. Irresoluteness/inconstancy -- failure to execute 
        > [!further] Failure to keep a resolution
        > Commitment is the heart of excellence and love. This is the vice which
        > inhibits commitment, therefore impeding excellence and love

> [!aside] 
> Every sin is a failure in all of the cardinal virtues, though there is an
> emphasis on which is in the forefront

#### III. Guidelines for Prudence  
1. Maintain the order of these above 3 steps
    1. Avoid deliberating after you've made your resolution. Don't keep
       rethinking it. 
       > [!quote]
       > Once you've reached discernment, act quickly and decisively
    2. There are times when one may need to reassess a resolution; ie, when new
       and relevant information comes to light
        1. "this is hard"/"I'm not enjoying this" do not count
            > [!further]
            > Because being virtuous is hard at the start, and it will not be
            > pleasant

            > [!further]
            > Resolutions are usually time-bound or finite in some way.

2. You cannot have absolute certainty in prudential decisions
    > piper the prudent man cannot expect...
    > Prudence does not give certainty
    1. Because one cannot fully consider all the (essentially) innumerable
       potentially relevant factors 

       > [!quote] Aquinas
       > Nothing prevents some counsel from being infinite potentially
       1. One must not refrain from decision -- xx until you've analyzed every possible consideration

        > [!aside]
        > What religious people often do, due to a lack of prudence, is appeal
        > to divine guidance until they feel like they can make a decision.
        > Very few people will hear the Lord call them like Samuel.
        > 
        > Catholics tend to have a prudential guidance model for making
        > decisions about everything except vocational discernment
        > 
        > If God comes to you in a dream or you get your rose from Terese, for
        > heavens sake take that into your decision making. But don't ask God to
        > cheat for you, in making the decision for you as opposed to you using
        > the faculties that he gave you that he wants you to use

3. Try to avoid decision-making during times of strong passion
    1. Reason and will should direct passion, not the other way around
        > [!quote] Sirach 10:6
        > Never act in a fit of passion
    1. Especially in times of:
        1. Lust
            > [!further]
            > Don't make decisions during periods of temptation.
            > Lust makes you stupid, so don't do anything. 

            > [!quote] Aquinas
            > Failure in prudence is caused chiefly by lust

        2. Anger
            > [!quote] Proverbs 15:1
            > By wrath even the prudent are lost

            > [!further]
            > Don't say anything when you're angry, don't do anything when
            > you're angry, and certainly don't keep a record, make a post, or
            > leave a paper trail when you're angry

        3. Discouragement 
            > [!quote] Aquinas
            > Depression makes you lose contact with the outside world
