# Virtue
2024-10-29

> Drawn from Pinckaers' appropriation of Aquinas

> Washing of the feet -- prefiguring of confession?
> "No one who has had a bath..." -- baptism, and feet washing is confession

> Sacrament as a gauge of holiness

#### I. Virtue and its Acquisition 
1. Nature of virtue
    1. *Habitus* -- disposition to act in a certain way
        1. Art -- disposition to act well in producing something or performing
           in some way
        2. Virtue -- disposition to act well such that the agent is perfected
        3. Vice -- disposition to act badly such that the agent is corrupted 
    2. Virtue -- moral perfection of a human ability 
    3. Involves the emotional life
        1. Take pleasure in doing what is morally right, displeasure in what is
           morally wrong
    4. "Stable" character trait
        > You could be a fluke (or have one, I guess)
    5. Virtue enables one to do what is good quickly, easily, and joyfully

2. Seven virtues 
    1. Cardinal/Acquired virtues -- Wisdom 8:7
        1. Accessible to non-Christians
    2. Theological virtues -- 1 Corinthians 13:13
    3. Pinckaers' analysis of virtue Acquisition through the lens of art (piano
       and foreign language)
        1. For beginners, the experience of acquiring these skills feels
           restrictive, rule-dominated, arbitrary, focused on not-screwing up,
            and unnatural 
            1. Temptation to quit
                > This is how beginners feel about the Church's moral teaching
        2. For those who submit long enough to the program, they become happier
           and freer for new modes of excellence 
        3. 2 Kinds of Freedom 
            1. Freedom of indifference
                1. OK place to start, but really bad place to end up
            2. Freedom for excellence
                1. You have to commit to something. You have to abandon and
                   cut down on some options to flourish at other ones. 
                2. Commitment is the essence of excellence and love
                    > You can't just 'keep your options open'
        4. Supposed to find mentors
