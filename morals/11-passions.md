# The Passions
2024-10-18
> Passions/Emotions/Feelings/Desires/Urges/Impulses are used here basically interchangeably, but "passions" is the way Aquinas talks about these

#### I. What NOT to do with your feelings
1. Eliminate/minimize -- Stoicism 
    1. Presents virtue as having as little feeling as possible
        > various trains of Buddhism, and certain Christian traditions
        1. "Apatheia" as ideal
    2. Can happen in a contemporary therapeutic context
    3. On the contrary, passion is God-given, part of the human design, and so
       is part of happiness or (or beatitude)
2. Submit to them -- Epicureanism 
    1. Sees the fundamental human project to be cultivating and satisfying
       desire
    2. Problems: There has to be some standard you use regarding which desire to
       fulfill.
        1. Many desires are mutually exclusive-- so, which do you satisfy?
        2. Strong desires or weak desires?
        > Really, nobody is an Epicurean

#### II. What are the Passions?
1. Our reactions to something that appears good (and therefore pleasing) or bad
   (and therefore displeasing)
    1. Distinguished based on the way the good or evil is perceived 
        > If a good or evil is perceived as being easy/uncomplicated to avoid or
        > attain, one experiences Concupicible Passions
        > 
        > | Perceived Good | Perceived Evil |
        > | -------------- | --------------- |
        > | Love (like)| hate (dislike) |
        > | desire | aversion |
        > | joy/pleasure | sorrow/pain |
        > 
        > If a good  or evil is perceived as difficult or complicated to
        > avoid/attain, one experiences irascible passions
        >
        > | Positive Passions | Negative Passions |
        > | -------------- | --------------- |
        > | Hope | Despair |
        > | Daring | Fear |
        > | Anger | --- |
        >
        > Joy and pleasure prompt rest, and not other actions

2. Passions are in the sense appetite 
    1. Affect us physically as well as psychically
        1. physical passion -- starts in the body and ends in the soul
        2. psychical passion -- starts in the soul and ends in the body
3. Passions follow apprehension/perception 
    > So you can have the wrong emotional response if you have the wrong
    perception

#### III. Forming the Passions
1. The passions are morally neutral 
    1. They are made moral when they prompt us to do what is morally right and
       avoid what is morally evil
    2. Moral propulsion system God has given us to pursue what the good and avoid
       evil not with will, but with feeling
        1. But because of concupiscence they don't do this reliably
2. So one has to form them, which happens in two ways
    > Not the same as fortitude and temperance
    1. Through the will, repeatedly choosing what is right regardless of
       disordered feeling
        1. "checking" the passions -- "fake it till you make it"
    2. Through the imagination, presenting appropriate images which cultivate
       the right passions at the right time
       > If the main goal you visualize is a creature, we call that an idol
       1. "commanding" the passions -- using ones imagination to focus on the pleasing aspects of what is good, and the displeasing aspects of what is evil

Our sense appetites:
1. Exist to draw us towards moral good and away from moral evil
2. Because of concupiscence, the Passions' tendency to be disordered, they don't
   do that reliably 
3. Have to be harnessed and redirected by
    - Checking -- refusing to give in to misdirected impulses
    - Commanding -- using imagination to cultivate the right passions
    > These describe avoiding the near occasion of sin
    > "best book" on non-material addition: Irresistible, Adam Altar
    > - Addiction is envirtonmental; changing the environment changes the
    > addiction
    > - "Pluck out your eye and cut off your hand" -- cutting things out of your
    > life that are near occasions of sin are going to feel like an amputation
    > 
    > St. Phillip Neri -- only cowards win the war; so, running away from the
    > temptation is the best thing
    >
    > Paul - "the carnal man cannot perceive things of the spirit"
