#### I. Virtue and its Acquisition 
1. Nature of virtue
    1. *Habitus* -- disposition to act in a certain way
        1. Art -- disposition to act well in producing something or performing
           in some way
        2. Virtue -- disposition to act well such that the agent is perfected
        3. Vice -- disposition to act badly such that the agent is corrupted 
    2. Virtue -- moral perfection of a human ability 
    3. Involves the emotional life
        1. Take pleasure in doing what is morally right, displeasure in what is
           morally wrong
    4. "Stable" character trait
        > You could be a fluke (or have one, I guess)
    5. Virtue enables one to do what is good quickly, easily, and joyfully

2. Seven virtues 
    1. Cardinal/Acquired virtues -- Wisdom 8:7
        1. Accessible to non-Christians
    2. Theological virtues -- 1 Corinthians 13:13
    3. Pinckaers' analysis of virtue Acquisition through the lens of art (piano
       and foreign language)
        1. For beginners, the experience of acquiring these skills feels
           restrictive, rule-dominated, arbitrary, focused on not-screwing up,
            and unnatural 
            1. Temptation to quit
                > This is how beginners feel about the Church's moral teaching
        2. For those who submit long enough to the program, they become happier
           and freer for new modes of excellence 
        3. 2 Kinds of Freedom 
            1. Freedom of indifference
                1. OK place to start, but really bad place to end up
            2. Freedom for excellence
                1. You have to commit to something. You have to abandon and
                   cut down on some options to flourish at other ones. 
                2. Commitment is the essence of excellence and love
                    > You can't just 'keep your options open'
        4. Supposed to find mentors


## Cardinal Virtues

#### I. Prudence
1. Nature of prudence
    1. The virtue that perfects conscience or acts of conscience
        1. Makes us excellent at applying word principles to concrete
           situations
           1. Presupposes a knowledge of both
                1. General principles
                2. Concrete particulars
    2. As an acquired virtue, prudence takes practice
    3. Prudence, like all the cardinal virtues, lies between extremes
        1. Involves a balance -- and balance is demanding
            1. Don't use "prudence" as a synonym for comfort
        2. Prudence makes one do the right thing, which often is not the most
           comfortable thing 
    4. Has to be the first of the cardinal virtues because it is intellectual --
       it is, as a foundation, based on reason. 
        1. You cannot do the good without knowing what the good is in the first
           place
