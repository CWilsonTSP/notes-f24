# Sin
2024-10-25

#### I. Nature of Sin
1. Sin -- a thought, word, or deed which is contrary to the Eternal law
2. "Causes" or parts of sin
    1. positive part -- the being of the thought, word, or deed (ontological)
        1. Caused by the attraction of the agent to some concrete good
        > No one can act, except toward some good
        >
        > In each, each person is pursing some perceived good. It can even be
        > basic, like 'agency' (toddlers learning they can do shit). Vengeance
        > is a desire for justice.
        >
        > It is to pursue being like God in a disordered way; in competition
        > with God instead of conforming with God

    2. Negative part -- privation
        1. privation -- absence of a "due good"; absence of a good that ought to
           be there
           > It is not a privation for man to have no wings, but it is for a
           > bird
        2. Privation involved in sin -- lack of conformity to reason and God's
           law
           > The implication here is that sin is irrational -- Longigen,
           > Maritain
           >
           > "Must be this high to ride the heaven slide"
           > oil laps -- the judgment is where you find out how much you were
           > missing

#### II. Distinctions among sins
> "The Catholic view of evil should make you less intimidated by evil"
1. Sin is a disorganized mess
    > Prima Pars Q. 73
    1. Virtue organizes the whole of life towards a single end which harmonizes
       all activity 
    2. Vice pursues goods that are unrelated to each other
        > The Eucharist pulls together unrelated accidents in an organized way,
        > and in this way culminates the virtue of charity
        1. it has a disintegrating dissipating effect
        2. Very difficult to make an organized taxonomy of sin
2. Source, root, and beginning of sin
    1. Self-love is the source of sin 
        1. Self-love == wanting some good for yourself
        2. All sin is wanting some (created) good for yourself in some
           disordered way
        3. Therefore, all sin is disordered self-love
    2. "Love of money" as "the root of all sin" 
        1. All sin is a form of worldliness -- has a disordered attachment to
           some worldly thing
        2. Money is thought to be the best way to secure worldly goods
            1. Symbol of worldliness
    3. Pride as the beginning of all sin
        > For Aquinas and Gregory, pride is not a "deadly sin"; all sin is pride
        1. Disordered pursuit of excellence 
            1. Pursing a good you have no businesses pursing

#### III. Internal Causes -- Faculty most associated with a given sin

> |  | Rational | Sensitive |
> | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
> | Apprehension | Intellect | Sense/imagination |
> | Appetition | Will | Passions |

1. Sins of ignorance  -- defect of intellect
2. Sins of weakness -- defect of passions
3. Sins of malice -- defect of the will

#### IV. Venial, mortal, Unpardonable Sin
1. Venial -- "wounds" but does not kill the life of grace
2. Mortal -- kills the life of grace, requires a miracle to restore 
    > Protestant and sometimes Orthodox complaint
    >
    > This is distinction is unimportant before you sin, but very important
    > after you sin
    >
    > We always access how much damage we have done -- we apologize in different
    > ways for different levels of severity
    1. Requires three things to be present:
        1. Grave matter
            > grave matter does not constitute mortal sin by itself
        2. Knowledge of the gravity
        3. Consent of the will
            > varied opinions on full vs sufficient consent
    2. If you have any decency, you do not engage in gestures of intimacy when
       you have betrayed the relationship and not yet made it right
       > To receive the Holy Eucharist in a state of mortal sin is to commit the
       > sin of Judas -- to betray Jesus with a kiss. It is a lie; taking this
       > gesture of intimacy and pretending like everything is fine.

       > This distinction of mortal and venial is something everyone does with
       > their relationship, and their relationship with Jesus ought to be no
       > exception
3. Unpardonable -- "Blasphemy against the Spirit"
    1. ~~Blaspheming against the Holy Spirit?~~
    2. ~~Could be a sin of malice?~~
    3. Final impenitence
        1. Since the Holy Spirit is the person of the Trinity to whom we have
           appropriated Sanctification, if you block Him, you commit this sin
        2. This is basically what the Magisterium teaches
