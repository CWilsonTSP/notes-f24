# Seven Deadly Sins
2024-12-03

Aquinas follows Gregory, and says that Pride is not one of the seven deadly
sins. Pride is at the root of every sin. All sin is disordered self-love; all
sin is a disordered pursuit of some excellence.

Part of going through this is to help us to realize how little some of these are
confessed.

> Pride is pursuing a good you have no business pursuing

> Following through De Malo

#### I. Vanity
> [!dict] "Wishing to be noticed"
> A Disordered preoccupation for praise or honor, with concern for self-image

1. Threefold division of Vanity
    1. Glory in something false
        > [!example]
        > Somebody praises a quality in you that you know you don't have, and you don't correct them, and you like it.
    2. Glory in something petty/insignificant/passing
        > [!example]
        > Praise for something that doesn't mean anything
    3. Glory in some praise that has no further benefit
        > [!example]
        > 
2. Three times when its legitimate (not vicious) to delight in praise
    1. God's glory
    2. Neighbor's edification
    3. Your own encouragement in virtue

> [!tldr] The Message of Vanity
> You do not have to brush aside every compliment, but compliments are like money
> and pleasure. All three are supposed to be ricochet effects of some good. If you
> pursue them fr their own sake, you pervert their purpose.

> [!book] The Furrow, Josemaria Escriva
> Identify dominate form of vanity in oneself

#### II. Envy
> [!dict] "Sorrow at another's good"
> A movement against another's good; the antithesis of love
1. Different from zeal
    > [!dict] Zeal
    > Sorrow that you don't have a due good which another exhibits
    1. This is virtuous, because it is not sorrow at someone else' good but a
       lack of your own
       > [!further]
       > In a way, Envy is the sickest of all the vices, because it response directly to the Good
       
       > [!quote] Wisdom 2:24
       > Through the envy of the devil, sin entered the world


2. Manifests as pleasure at another's misfortune
    > [!further]
    > Best way you know you have envy is how you talk about a person -- envy prompts us to talk indirectly about a person. What is your impulse to say when someone's name comes up?

    > [!example]
    > When something good happens to someone else, you sarcastically say "oh that's nice!" and go find a puppy to kick. Whens something bad happens to someone else, a big grin comes over your face and you excitedly share it with others.


> [!aside] Gregory's defense against envy
> Desiring only that which is not diminished by being shared

#### III. Sloth/Acedia
> [!dict] "Spiritual Apathy"
> Sorrow or boredom at spiritual or inner goods; losing your focus about 'the goal'

> [!aside]
> Very closely linked to despair. This vice, if you don't fight it, will kill
your faith.

1. Manifests in two ways
    1. Busyness/hypractivity 
        > [!example]
        > A teacher gives an assignment in class, and immediately you start going. When you turn it in, it is instead 8 pages of doodles instead of 8 pages of work. You get an F on the assignment, because even though you 'worked', you did not do the assignment.
        >
        > The assigment is to become a saint. Of you put more effort into anything than that, that is sloth.
    2. Entertainment/distraction
        > "Lord, look at how many episodes of this show I watched!"


        > [!further]
        > A lot of times, these two go together. You get overwhelmed with what you have to do, so you doomscroll or binge watch shows, and then get frustrated with how much you have yet to do

#### IV. Wrath
> [!dict] "Unrighteous Anger"

1. Anger can be disordered in three ways:
    1. Disproportionate 
    2. Directed at an evil which is not your place to correct
    3. Not directed towards removing an evil at all

#### V. Avarice
> [!dict] "Greed"
> Disordered preoccupation with money and material things, that is, the stuff that money can buy or preserve.

> [!aside] 
> One nobody thinks they have, because everybody has it

1. Number one Symptom -- financial anxiety

    > [!example]
    > If you ask almost every single undergraduate at the Mount, the answer is nearly always money. "To get a good job" or something similar
    > "How are we going to make ends meet?" "The kids have to go to college, we have to keep the money"

    > [!aside] 
    > The number one reason for rejecting children is financial

#### VI. Gluttony 
> [!dict] ""
> Disorder in the desire for food and drink

1. Sin of Drunkenness 
    1. Directly against the last end by attacking the faculties by which we will
       be united to God.
        > [!example] Aquinas
        > The way we get to God is by the intellect and will. To the extent that you mutilate these faculties, you are working directly against Him when you inhibit your mind and freedom. This is the same thing that is wrong with recreational drug use, in the sense that you are intentionally inhibiting your faculties. 

2. Five kinds of Gluttony
    1. Quantity
        1. Refusing to eat something can also be Gluttony
    
        > [!quote] Screwtape Letters
        > Hammer on the "all I want"; she doesn't think she is gluttonous, but she will complain about what is not made to her specifications.

    2. Quality

#### VII. Lust
> [!dict] 
> Sexuality that is not conducive to either the begetting of children or the rearing of children
