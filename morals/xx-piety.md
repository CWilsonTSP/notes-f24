 - Topic: virtues and gifts of spirit and how they line up and are related
### Virtue of Piety
1. What you owe those above you, whether God or some human being.
	1. Just as 4th commandment is bridge virtue between the first three and last six commandments, so the virtue of piety is the bridge between the two forms of justice
	2. Chiefly directed to God and parents, to whom you owe the source of being
		1. As an adult you owe your parents (CCC at end of 4th commandment)
			1. consideration of their preferences
			2. asking of advice
			3. gratitude for their just admonitions
			4. you retain an attitude of deference
			5. you are to support them in old age morally and materially
2. The main driver of piety is gratitude - gratitude is supposed to define our relationship with God and those who are above us.
3. One time the Lord mentions gratitude: the ten lepers
	1. obstacle to gratitude? Thinking of things in terms of what you have left to do in leiu of what God has done _for_ you.
	2. Just think what a sonofabitch you'd be without Christ and apply that to everything else.
	3. Thomas Aquinas 2a2aeq6a2: who should be more grateful to God?  There's a sense in which they should be equally grateful - either they've been given an extraordinary gift through purity, or given the gift in an extraordinary way through mercy
	4. Do you want to be grateful? Sit down and list 25 things you're grateful for on paper, and then keep it in your pocket and see if you can really complain after that.  when you forget, do it again.

### Commutative justice
1. Kinds of justice to neighbor:
	1. commutative - pertains to what one individual owes another
		1. The contemporary catholic social teaching of the church says that in the globalized world, this can apply to justice between seperate nations
		2. without this everyone goes around screwing over their neighbor
	2. Distributive - pertains to what the community owes the individual
		1. this is the justice that should govern a ruler, as he decides what is due to the members of a community
		2. this is what applies to every voter while voting, but not to each member when seeking benefits from government
		3. without this the community screws over an individual or particular group
	3. Legal/General justice - pertains to what the individual owes the community
		1. without this there is an entitlement mindset where the people try to screw over the community
	4. What makes democracy tricky: is sometimes people have to ask what does the community owe me, and sometimes people have to ask what do I owe the community?  When a leader says "vote for me and I will give you this or that" this is a sign that the just democracy is falling apart
2. Violations of commutative justice:
	1. Murder: when one individual takes the life of another to which they have a right to.
		1. taking what someone else has a right to - their relatively innocent life.
		2. Suicide: a sin in three ways:
			1. against love for oneself -> As your being is good, this is an attack on that goodness.
			2. against justice to God ->  As life belongs to God, you can't go around breaking it.
			3. against justice to society -> to attack society's members is to attack society.
				1. What we have to do is to take a strong postition against the heinous horror of suicide and then hope in accord with church teaching for their salvation.  __these three preceeding points show the objective evil, but does not indicate culpability.__ Objective evil != subjective culpability.  
				2. While the Church always upholds every aspect of the truth, her disciplinary practice will highlight only some parts at a given time.  It used to be that those who committed suicide could not be given catholic burial to emphasize objective horror, now we permit it to emphasize that the horrible nature of the act does not indicate culpability.
	2. Theft: can take a lot of forms: secret, open, cheating, pyramid schemes, shoddy work, etc.
		1. Why is private property a good and natural thing and therefore makes demands relative to justice?
			1. Marx famously said that evil entered the world when one fool drew a line around something and said "mine" and other fools believed him.  this is wrong.
			2. Why is it good for the individual man and society as a whole?
				1. Aquinas says:
					1. Promotes responsibility
					2. less complicated and less confusing - if everyone has to share everything all the time that would be a nightmare.
					3. More peaceful
				2. Modern catholic social teaching says:
					1. Private property enables a man to store the value or meaning of his work - this is what money is -> the symbol that you have done something good to someone, and now someone ought do good to you
					3. Promotes initiative: you have resources from which to act
					4. Prevents opression: if I have six months saved up, if my employer demands immoral actions, I can say no more freely.
			3. Private property is prudential and necessary, the form it takes can be debated as good or bad.
		2. The limits of private property - private property is not _absolute._
			1. It has to be subordinated to the common good (e.g. if someone lends you his sword and comes back in a drunken rage asking for it back, you cannot give it back as it violates the common order)
				1. You can't give someone something or return private property to its owner if they are going to do something with it that is gravely detrimental to society
			2. in cases of extreme need, one can take from someone's excess - yours or another's because things are for people, and the extreme need makes it yours.
				1.  Catholic social teaching: universal access principle / universal destination of goods:  the goods of the earth were made for everyone, and a distribution mechanism that badly fails has to be adjusted or supplemented.
					1. e.g. when Dr. M was growing up, his family got a big van, and his parents would bring back anything: one day they brought back a llama.  Most big families when they have a big car, there's a distribution method for seating: one such mechanism is "I called it"  However, if anyone called all the seats, the parents would have intervened -> the distribution claim goes against the purpose of the van in the first place.  If the distribution mechanism goes against this, the parents will adjust the mechanism.
	3. Sins of Speech:
		1. Types:
			1. Reviling
			2. Taunting
			3. berailing
			4. backbiting
			5. deriding
			6. upbraiding
			7. etc.
			8. QQ 72-75
		2. These can be mortal:
			1. e.g. a wife who publicly and repeatedly shames her unfaithful husband also becomes a perpetrator
			2. A man loves his honor no less than his posessions
		3. It can be a mortal sin just to listen: Psalm 1:1 - just sitting in the council of sinners can be sinful.
			1. C.S. Lewis on the psalms on the sins of the toungue: the psalter speaks harshly and repeatedly against sins of speech - slander, gossip, etc.
		4. The sin is exacerbated when it is about someone in authority.  prov 30:17
			1. when you become a priest do not talk smack about other priests to laypeople - it's like when the parents are arguing, and it's hard for the faithful to obey the fourth commanment here on account of your authority.
